By injecting a payload into an issue title an attacker could exfiltrate data or execute code on the target machine. For instance, by naming an issue `=cmd|' /C calc'!A0` I am able to open up calc.exe on Windows.\n\n# Steps to reproduce\n---\n\n1) Create an issue with `=cmd|' /C calc'!A0` as the title;\n2) Export all issues (The file is sent as an email attachment);\n3) Open the .csv file on a Windows machine.\n\n**Result:** calc.exe pops up.\n\n# Fix\n---\n\nPrefix `=`, `+`, `-` and `@` symbols with a `'` in issues when exporting them to a .csv file.\n\nIf you require any further information, feel free to contact me.\n\nBest regards,\nEd",
