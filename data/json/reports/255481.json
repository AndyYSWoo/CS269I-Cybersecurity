But upon further inspection, it looks like Firefox supported arrow functions all the way back as far as version 45, which just happens to be the version that the current version of Firefox ESR is reporting in the user agent string. So, we've updated our redirect logic to support Firefox (tested up to date ESR on Kali) as far back as version 45.
