We prioritize issues -  reports containing trivial issues with limited (or no) business impact and badly written reports with insufficient information on how to reproduce the issue receive a lower priority. Please do not request updates for at least 20 days into the process. Once triaged and verified, bounty decisions are made 1-2 times per month.</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: if we frequently dismiss your reports, make sure you have read our policy and stay in scope and that you know how to write good reports - <a title=\"https://support.hackerone.com/hc/en-us/articles/211538803-Step-by-Step-How-to-write-a-good-vulnerability-report\" href=\"/redirect?signature=4a5425e8988ac17fee1486083adea42f02a69a52&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.hackerone.com%2Fhc%2Fen-us%2Farticles%2F211538803-Step-by-Step-How-to-write-a-good-vulnerability-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://support.hackerone.com/hc/en-us/articles/211538803-Step-by-Step-How-to-write-a-good-vulnerability-report</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a> and <a title=\"http://blog.bugcrowd.com/advice-for-writing-a-great-vulnerability-report/\" href=\"/redirect?signature=8c946efce5c7782533f2fcab04119fa1615d6138&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.bugcrowd.com%2Fadvice-for-writing-a-great-vulnerability-report%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>http://blog.bugcrowd.com/advice-for-writing-a-great-vulnerability-report/</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a>.
