Create a ticket with user B at BugBug\r\n2. Create a ticket with user C at BugBug\r\n3. Mark user C's ticket as resolved \r\n4. Mark user B's ticket as Duplicate of user C's ticket\r\n5. Now reopen user C's ticket and mark it as resolved.\r\n6. Repeat the last step, that is step 5 for 50 times and you'll see user B's reputation will boost up by 100 points. And of course there won't be any trace on user B's profile publicly as the ticket is marked duplicate.  \r\n\r\nP.S: All program associated steps are done by user A like marking ticket as resolved/dupe\r\n\r\n\r\nTo avoid confusion here's a short video as well - [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rsaa6havq08fk7p/Reputation%20Logic.mov?dl=0)\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPrakhar Prasad",
