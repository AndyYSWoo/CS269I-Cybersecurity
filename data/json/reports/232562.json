    "vulnerability_information": "Good afternoon,\n\nThe following url https://cuvva-alternate.app.link/ITHZI8FrKB?__branch_flow_type=deepview_tmta&__branch_flow_id=397220061845644344&__branch_desktop_deepview_type=1 can be used to spam phone numbers remotely.\n\n###Example POC:\n\n```\n<html>\n<form action=\"https://cuvva-alternate.app.link/ITHZI8FrKB?__branch_flow_type=deepview_tmta&__branch_flow_id=397220061845644344&__branch_desktop_deepview_type=1\" method=\"POST\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<input name=\"phone\" id=\"phone\" type=\"text\" class=\"light\" value=\"+44\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<button id=\"phone_submit\" class=\"light\">Send</button>\n\t\t\t\t\t</form>\n</html>\t\n```\n\nAfter grabbing the form code I can spam numbers from my desktop, I tested this on my number of course. *No cell phone bills were jacked up during the making of this poc.* :]\n\n1. Enter a known cell phone number.\n2. Submit and recieve the download the app text.\n3. Continuously refresh the page to keep spamming the number or create a loop with javascript.\n\n###Steps to fix:\n\n- Set a certain number of post requests per IP.\n- Set a captcha.\n- Set a limit. As of now I don't think there's a limit so this can be a gateway for spamming.\n\nAs a side note usually outside source requests are checked by a referrer attribute to make sure It's valid.\n\n I'm not entirely sure if you have control over this domain but I still wanted Cuvva to be aware of the vulnerability. As being spammed through a Cuvva download link wouldn't sit well with potential customers or their cell phone bill. Please let me know if you have any questions. I'm happy to help!\n",
