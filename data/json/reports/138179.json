If\nclear-key bytes are present for these ciphers, they *displace* encrypted-key\nbytes. This leads to an efficient divide-and-conquer key recovery attack: if an\neavesdropper has intercepted an SSLv2 handshake, they can use the server as an\noracle to determine the SSLv2 master-key, using only 16 connections to the\nserver and negligible computation.\n\nMore importantly, this leads to a more efficient version of DROWN that is\neffective against non-export ciphersuites, and requires no significant\ncomputation.\n\nThis issue affected OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.0.1l, 1.0.0q, 0.9.8ze and all\nearlier versions.  It was fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2a, 1.0.1m, 1.0.0r and 0.9.8zf\n(released March 19th 2015).\n\nThis issue was reported to OpenSSL on February 10th 2016 by David Adrian and J.\nAlex Halderman of the University of Michigan.
