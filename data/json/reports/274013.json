Recently, the report #260468 is disclosed publicly and that report describes about the restriction lengths of profile fields \"first name and last name\".  Now, i am reporting an another vulnerability regarding those profile fields \"first name and last name and also Bio field\".\n\nVulnerability:-\n->Meta characters are not being filtered in \"First Name and Last Name\" and \"Bio\" fields while creating a profile on app.legalrobot.com\n\nDescription:-\n->You haven't filtered control meta characters such as %00 etc; in full name field and bio field, it allows an attacker to impersonate or hide their real identity within the application.\n->It turns out that it is possible to register a user's full name and also bio field can be updated with special sign %0a(appended in proxy).\n\nImpact:-\n->An attacker can impersonate user by appending meta characters.\n\nSteps to reproduce:-\n->Go to app.legalrobot.com and create an account\n->Now go to profile\n->By using meta characters, fill the name fields and bio fields\n->You profile will get updated.\n\nMitigation:-\n->You should disallow null bytes in the \"Name\" and \"Bio\" fields.\n->That is by filtering full_name to only unicode word characters and a limited set of special characters.\n\nAny issues, please let me know.\n\nThank you",

Recently, the report <a href=\"/reports/260468\">#260468</a> is disclosed publicly and that report describes about the restriction lengths of profile fields &quot;first name and last name&quot;.  Now, i am reporting an another vulnerability regarding those profile fields &quot;first name and last name and also Bio field&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Vulnerability:-<br>\n-&gt;Meta characters are not being filtered in &quot;First Name and Last Name&quot; and &quot;Bio&quot; fields while creating a profile on app.legalrobot.com</p>\n\n<p>Description:-<br>\n-&gt;You haven&#39;t filtered control meta characters such as %00 etc; in full name field and bio field, it allows an attacker to impersonate or hide their real identity within the application.<br>\n-&gt;It turns out that it is possible to register a user&#39;s full name and also bio field can be updated with special sign %0a(appended in proxy).</p>\n\n<p>Impact:-<br>\n-&gt;An attacker can impersonate user by appending meta characters.</p>\n\n<p>Steps to reproduce:-<br>\n-&gt;Go to app.legalrobot.com and create an account<br>\n-&gt;Now go to profile<br>\n-&gt;By using meta characters, fill the name fields and bio fields<br>\n-&gt;You profile will get updated.</p>\n\n<p>Mitigation:-<br>\n-&gt;You should disallow null bytes in the &quot;Name&quot; and &quot;Bio&quot; fields.<br>\n-&gt;That is by filtering full_name to only unicode word characters and a limited set of special characters.</p>\n\n<p>Any issues, please let me know.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you</p>\n",
