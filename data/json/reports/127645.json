Let me explain what is happening here again.\n\nIt guess, SSO/Session implementation is working like this.\n\n1) login.uber.com is a centralized server, where authentication happens.\n2) All other services (riders.uber.com, developer.ber.com etc) gets the authorization token, and creates their own session.\n3) When user logout of any service, it clears their service session and redirects the user to login.uber.com to clear global session.\n4) But what about other service session tokens???\n\nriders.uber.com is the case, let say, \n1) login into riders.uber.com & partners.uber.com\n2) Logout from partners.uber.com, it logouts from both partners.uber.com & login.uber.com but not from riders.uber.com\n\nSo, when using multiple domains, you need to keep the shared cookies/sessions in sync, meaning that if you log out from an app, you need to also delete the auth cookie to ensure that users are globally logged out across all services. \n\nAnother issue I submitted along with this is https://hackerone.com/reports/127627 (similar issue). I would like to say, SSO/Session implementation is not adequate.\n\n**Coming to security issues:**\n1) Serious consequences could be, user might be assuming he is updating his account and may enter his credit card details in attacker account when they share the device (eg: office environment, public internet cafe etc).\n2) User might be having multiple accounts, he might be switching himself between his accounts (business & personal account), he can mistakenly add office card in personal or vice versa.\n\nThis url (https://riders.uber.com/oauth/callback?code={AUTH_TOKEN}) is vulnerable to CSRF attacks, luckily internal server error is throwing up. Otherwise, this would have been more critical issue (attacker could have attacked easily), please add state param to your sso implementation.\n\nThanks\n",
