    "vulnerability_information": "## Basic report information\n**Summary:** \nThe lahitapiolarahoitus.fi contains an SWF-file which is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting attacks via crafted URL.\n\n**Description:** \nThe file `https://www.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi/wp-includes/js/mediaelement/mediaelement-flash-audio-ogg.swf` contains a XSS-vulnerability which allows malicious actor to create URLs which contain javascript. When the victim (anonymous or authenticated) opens this URL, the javascript is executed on the victim's session.\n\n**Impact:**\nThe vulnerability allows an attacker to use every functionality on lahitapiolarahoitus.fi that the victim is able to use. In case of an admin-victim, the attacker can use this to gain RCE on the server by uploading a malicious shell-plugin. The vulnerability can also be used to redirect the victim to a malicious third-party domain and also to serve spoofed content on the lahitapiolarahoitus.fi-domain. If the myynti.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi uses domain-wide cookies, this vulnerability can possibly be used to read/write these cookies. \n\n## Browsers / Apps Verified In:\n\n  * Latest Firefox\n  * Latest Internet Explorer\n  * Latest Edge\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. Go to URL https://www.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi/wp-includes/js/mediaelement/mediaelement-flash-audio-ogg.swf?uid=\"]}))}catch(e){}alert(document.cookie)//\n  2. Notice, that the user's cookies are shown.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nAs the vulnerable files are removed in the latest Wordpress version, simply update your own version to the latest one. If the previous is not possible, just remove the swf-files as those are fairly rarely neede.\n\n## Additional material\n\n  * https://wordpress.org/news/2018/01/wordpress-4-9-2-security-and-maintenance-release/\n\n## Related reports, best practices\n\n  * https://hackerone.com/reports/134546\n\n## Impact\n\nThe vulnerability allows an attacker to use every functionality on lahitapiolarahoitus.fi that the victim is able to use. In case of an admin-victim, the attacker can use this to gain RCE on the server by uploading a malicious shell-plugin. The vulnerability can also be used to redirect the victim to a malicious third-party domain and also to serve spoofed content on the lahitapiolarahoitus.fi-domain.
