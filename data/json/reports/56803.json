Create a dropbox account\r\n2. Create a folder\r\n3. Invite victim to collaborate with new folder ([instructions](https://www.dropbox.com/en/help/19)).\r\n4. Create a file called test.html within the folder with the contents below.\r\n\r\n    <html><body><script>alert(document.domain);</body></html>\r\n\r\nFor victim to run the exploit, they need to take the following steps\r\n\r\n1. Accept invitation to collaborate\r\n2. Open shared folder, select the file test.html (not to preview, just to the side of the name, so that you can do next step).\r\n3. Above file listings, the option \"Previous versions\" should be available, click on that\r\n4. Click on the vulnerable version, it should open a URL such as https://dl-web.dropbox.com/get/sharedfoldername/test.html?some unique parameters\r\n5.
