Another administrator may reconfigure the share, resulting in the same problem we have now.\n\n**2. Require administrators to disable anonymous access and have a check in the PHP code**\n\nWe could require administrators to configure their server in a way that no anonymous nor guest login is permitted. This would be possible by simply performing something like `smbclient -L '//127.0.0.1/dummy' --no-pass`.\n\nThis seems like a straight forward possibility. However, it won't wake with the `map to guest` config switch. Here would simply have to be guest access forbidden globally, such as with:\n\n```\nrestrict anonymous = 2\n```\n\n**3. Check on login with another random password as well**\n\nSomething that came to my mind that certainly isn't the most cleanest solution but seems to mitigate this problem is: Just check twice for the password.\n\nSo basically once the user has authenticated in `\\OC_User_SMB::checkPassword` we perform another password check with a different password. If the login works also with the invalid password (which could simply be a ROT-13) then we cancel the login. If the login fails with the wrong password then we proceed.\n\nAt the moment this is something that I personally would be in favour of.

This is the default on SMB servers nowadays and allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain access to an account without valid credentials. \n\n**Note:** The SMB backend is disabled by default and requires manual configuration in the Nextcloud config file.

    "vulnerability_information": "Authentication Bypass\n==================\n\nThe external user authentication app in OwnCloud does not properly authenticate against an SMB server. In it's current implementation, the file (owncloud/apps/user_external/lib/smb.php, line 46-47) uses the command `smbclient -L //host/dummy -Uuser%pass`, where the variables `user` and `pass` are escaped for shell characters. However, default Samba SMB servers set \"map to guest\" to the value \"bad user\". This allows for the listing of shares regardless of user, but not further information. \n\nThe image shows the command `smbclient -L //localhost/dummy -Utest%test` succeeding with an invalid user \"test\" using password \"test\", yet the user does not exist as shown by the second command `smbclient //localhost/dummy -Utest%test`.\n\n{F102413}\n\nWhen the default \"map to guest\" parameter is changed to \"never\" in the smb.conf for the SMB server, both commands fail as required.\n\n{F102414}\n\nTo properly validate the user the command should simply be `smbclient //host -Uuser%pass`. This properly authenticates the user and returns a valid error message the the script can interpret. In it's current implementation, providing any username to the application will log you in as that user - even creating a new one if necessary.\n\nTo Replicate\n------------------\n1. Set up a Samba SMB server like detailed on this page:\n\nhttps://help.ubuntu.com/community/How%20to%20Create%20a%20Network%20Share%20Via%20Samba%20Via%20CLI%20(Command-line%20interface/Linux%20Terminal)%20-%20Uncomplicated,%20Simple%20and%20Brief%20Way!\n\n2. Login to the OwnCloud application and enable the external user authentication app.\n\n3. Edit the config and add:\n'user_backends' => \n  array (\n    0 => \n    array (\n      'class' => 'OC_User_SMB',\n      'arguments' => \n      array (\n        0 => 'SMBHOST',\n      ),\n    ),\n  ),\n\n3. If a user already exists and you have the username, you can login using any password (including the administrator account!). If user doesn't exist, it will create said user and log you in.\n\n\nUntrusted Parameter Host\n======================\n\nIn the same php file (owncloud/apps/user_external/lib/smb.php, line 46-47) the parameter `host` is not properly escaped.
