    "vulnerability_information": "**Summary**\nA HackerOne employee Reed Loden ([GitHub:reedloden](https://github.com/reedloden)) exposed their personal access token twice in build logs of the [rubysec/rubysec.github.io](https://github.com/rubysec/rubysec.github.io) project:\n1. [2015-12-10](https://travis-ci.org/rubysec/rubysec.github.io/jobs/95954424#L258)\n2. [2016-03-01](https://travis-ci.org/rubysec/rubysec.github.io/jobs/112766749#L319)\n\n**Description**\nThe token has `public_repo` [scope](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes), which means that it allows access to any *public* repos the owner account has access to, with the same permissions. This includes all public repositories under [Hacker0x01](https://github.com/Hacker0x01), for which Reed has full access: pull, push, as well as admin permissions.\n\n**Cause**\nThe cause of this as far as I can tell is incorrect  use of `git push` command in [the script](https://github.com/rubysec/ruby-advisory-db/blob/master/scripts/post-advisories.sh#L18):  passing a`-q`/`--quiet` option is not enough, as according to help it *\u201cSuppresses all output <\u2026> unless an error occurs\u201d*, which happened in those two cases, in turn because of missing `--force` option.\n\n**Other**\nIn addition to revoking the token, you might want to review *any* commits to your repositories since the first exposure. The token allows to push from the Reeds account, but commit's author/committer can be set to anything. As far as I know, there's no UI on GitHUb to see what commits were *pushed* from the particular account.\n\nAlso, please, make sure not to disclose this issue publicly (including by accident, with a commit message, for example) at least for some time. Revoking/rotating token with a generic \u201cupdating the token\u201d commit should be fine though, as generally nobody pays attention to them.\n\nNote, that I've contacted GitHub to perform mass revocation of credentials that I found, but they aren't as fast as I hoped, so meanwhile I'm trying to notify affected parties individually.",

This includes all public repositories under <a href=\"/redirect?signature=10cc263c4a308dfcf62cd8f4c9016770949c4924&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FHacker0x01\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>Hacker0x01</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a>, for which Reed has full access: pull, push, as well as admin permissions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cause</strong><br>\nThe cause of this as far as I can tell is incorrect  use of <code>git push</code> command in <a href=\"/redirect?signature=1521a9d4ef32f6b43ae2241cc720e2c4167a32b3&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Frubysec%2Fruby-advisory-db%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fscripts%2Fpost-advisories.sh%23L18\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>the script</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a>:  passing a<code>-q</code>/<code>--quiet</code> option is not enough, as according to help it <em>\u201cSuppresses all output &lt;\u2026&gt; unless an error occurs\u201d</em>, which happened in those two cases, in turn because of missing <code>--force</code> option.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Other</strong><br>\nIn addition to revoking the token, you might want to review <em>any</em> commits to your repositories since the first exposure. The token allows to push from the Reeds account, but commit&#39;s author/committer can be set to anything. As far as I know, there&#39;s no UI on GitHUb to see what commits were <em>pushed</em> from the particular account.</p>\n\n<p>Also, please, make sure not to disclose this issue publicly (including by accident, with a commit message, for example) at least for some time. Revoking/rotating token with a generic \u201cupdating the token\u201d commit should be fine though, as generally nobody pays attention to them.</p>\n\n<p>Note, that I&#39;ve contacted GitHub to perform mass revocation of credentials that I found, but they aren&#39;t as fast as I hoped, so meanwhile I&#39;m trying to notify affected parties individually.</p>\n",
