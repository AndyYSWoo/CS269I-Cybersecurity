    "vulnerability_information": "I think I have found a security issue . \n\nSummery:\n---------------------\nInviting a person to Project who has an expired account can participate in project activity via email address , Which is against Mavenlink's business policy , As after an account has been expired after trial period they need to buy a plan to access all the features . \n\n\nIssue Background:\n---------------------\nAs we know on signing up , Mavenlink Offers a Trial account of a limited period , where users can check out all the features and gets a basic understanding how Mavenlink works . However after the trial period is over for a free account , Upon logging in to the actors account he gets a message like this and it's not possible to access anything at all as this comes every time . \n\nF213824 \n\nSo , If user does not chooses a plan he actually can not access this account now , Trying to navigate to any section brings to \n\n```\nhttps://app.mavenlink.com/settings/account/subscription?showPlansPricing=true\n```\n\nWhere Mavenlink prompts user to select a plan to continue using the features of the application . However If someone creates a project and invites the expired account holder , he receives and email that he has been invited to the project . when he tries to open it he can not access this as I have mentioned the application lands to the same page and prompts to buy a plan . however if the expired account owner replies the email , a comment is placed at the project . particularly  when any post is made on the project timeline that expired account holder receives an email , and replying that email he can participate  in the conversation without any problem  . wheres if the expired account holder tries to access the project with direct link he can not and land on the same page again where he needs to choose a plan to move forward with Mavenlink . \n\nSo , an actor can post comment/ participate in conversations  via email when he actually does not have access to that due to Mavenlink's business policy via the application . Which seems the actor is getting more access / privilege more than he should get , and that is why I belief this is a security issue . \n\nProof Of Concept:\n---------------------\n\n- Create a project with your Mavenlink Account . \n- Invite the person whose account status is expired . \n-  Add him as a consultant\n- He will receive an email which is associated to his Mavenlink account . \n- He will try to navigate for the link received via email to see the project . \n- The attempt would be unsuccessful due to Mavenlink's policy .\n- As the application will not let the actor to access before he selects a paid plan . \n- Now create a post from your account \n- An email will go to that expired users address . \n- he replies the email \n- and comment gets posted on behalf of him . \n- But he actually cannot get access . \n\nHow can it  affect Mavenlink :\n---------------------\nThe user is getting the privilege to participate in a project what he could have after selecting a paid plan , he can make comments by simply replying the email he received , unethical actors may take advantage of this current behavior which will eventually affect Mavenlink financially . As the user can perform this action without selecting a paid plan . \n\nI am attaching a video demonstration . Hope you will investigate this and get back with an update , \n\nSincerely  , \nRashed \n\n\n",

However If someone creates a project and invites the expired account holder , he receives and email that he has been invited to the project . when he tries to open it he can not access this as I have mentioned the application lands to the same page and prompts to buy a plan . however if the expired account owner replies the email , a comment is placed at the project . particularly  when any post is made on the project timeline that expired account holder receives an email , and replying that email he can participate  in the conversation without any problem  . wheres if the expired account holder tries to access the project with direct link he can not and land on the same page again where he needs to choose a plan to move forward with Mavenlink . </p>\n\n<p>So , an actor can post comment/ participate in conversations  via email when he actually does not have access to that due to Mavenlink&#39;s business policy via the application . Which seems the actor is getting more access / privilege more than he should get , and that is why I belief this is a security issue . </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"proof-of-concept\">Proof Of Concept:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Create a project with your Mavenlink Account . </li>\n<li>Invite the person whose account status is expired . </li>\n<li> Add him as a consultant</li>\n<li>He will receive an email which is associated to his Mavenlink account . </li>\n<li>He will try to navigate for the link received via email to see the project . </li>\n<li>The attempt would be unsuccessful due to Mavenlink&#39;s policy .</li>\n<li>As the application will not let the actor to access before he selects a paid plan . </li>\n<li>Now create a post from your account </li>\n<li>An email will go to that expired users address . </li>\n<li>he replies the email </li>\n<li>and comment gets posted on behalf of him . </li>\n<li>But he actually cannot get access . </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-can-it-affect-mavenlink\">How can it  affect Mavenlink :</h2>\n\n<p>The user is getting the privilege to participate in a project what he could have after selecting a paid plan , he can make comments by simply replying the email he received , unethical actors may take advantage of this current behavior which will eventually affect Mavenlink financially . As the user can perform this action without selecting a paid plan . </p>\n\n<p>I am attaching a video demonstration . Hope you will investigate this and get back with an update , </p>\n\n<p>Sincerely  , <br>\nRashed </p>\n",
