The specific line of code responsible for the generation is [this one](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/c19f1f27cecd7024df0ff8b4ace400d665dd9576/lib/devise.rb#L485). Let's assume that all data other than this random string is known.\n\nIf we assume SecureRandom is generating properly random numbers, we have 15*8 bits of entropy. This means there are 2^(8*15) possible keys [(approximately 1,3 * 10^36)](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2%5E%288*15%29). \n\nOur most basic rate limiting is done in our load-balancer. What we do (basically), is allow every IP-address to make a maximum of 10 requests per second. This means that the minimal (average) time taken for each request would be 0.1 second. At this rate it would take a single computer 1,3 * 10^36 * 0.1 seconds to brute-force the entire key-space. On average you would expect to have found your key by the time you're halfway through the keyspace, so let's make that 1,3 * 10^36 * 0.1 second / 2. As you [can see](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%282%5E%288*15%29+*+0.1+second%29+%2F+2), this would take 1,5 * 10^17 times the age of the universe. \n\nLet's say you're quite dedicated to steal someone's account. You take 5 years to plot your ultimate revenge. You're going to use every single internet connected device to try to brute-force your way to victory. [It is estimated](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2905717) that there will be around 25 billion devices connected to the internet by 2020. Unfortunately this still means that brute-forcing the token will take on average [6.100.000 years](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%282%5E%288*15%29+*+0.1+second%29+%2F+2%29+%2F+25+billion) to gain access.\n\nFun fact: using `curl https://hackerone.com/current_user -H 'Cookie: remember_user_token=[..redacted..]' -w '%{size_request}'` we can determine that during the request 215 bytes have been sent to HackerOne. During the high-point of your attack, you will be sending 430 Terrabits per second to HackerOne, doubling the global IP traffic rate (and probably melting our load-balancer).\n\nWhile you have a point in the severely reduced size of the keyspace, I think you'll agree that it's still quite formidable.\n\nKind regards",
