Note that I have seen your report, but I haven\u2019t done any verification on my own so I really apologize for any silly questions.\n\n**Issue 1: SSL Certificate Verification**\nI\u2019m a bit unclear if you\u2019re saying that the SSL verification itself is failing (i.e. you could proxy the traffic using Charles Proxy without installing a certificate) or if you\u2019re saying that there is a lack of certificate pinning? https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Certificate_and_Public_Key_Pinning\n\nGiven your description includes installing another root CA on the device, my guess is that you\u2019re describing the latter? If so, in general I would not consider this a vulnerability, but more of a defense-in-depth mechanism. In order to exploit this issue, an attacker would have to trick a victim into installing another root CA on their phone. At that point, the attacker could also arbitrarily MITM all of the user\u2019s non-pinned traffic (including all browser activity for example). Please let me know if I\u2019m misunderstanding your issue.\n\nIf you do plan on publishing I would *highly* recommend changing the title to \u201clack of certificate pinning\u201d. As written, it makes it sound like SSL Certificate Verification is failing, which is a *much* more serious issue and could lead to serious misinterpretation. SSL Certificate Verification is properly being performed (if my guess as to what you\u2019re saying is correct).\n\n**Issue 2: API Key Security**\nI want to separate out this from issue 1. Issue 1 describes the ability to intercept SSL if a victim installs a malicious CA on their phone.\n\nThe first thing you\u2019re describing is actually the intended behavior of the Oauth2 protocol (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749). Oauth 2 was indeed controversial because it sends secrets in messages, but the justification is that it requires SSL verification.\n\nThe second thing: hardcoded keys in the Coinbase source that is publicly available. This is a classic \u201cproblem\u201d, and I\u2019m not actually sure how to weigh in here. Julian can likely tell us more. In my opinion, the real vulnerability is if you rely on those as things to remain secret. Most applications are not. Rotating keys and obfuscating won\u2019t save these secrets either, there is basically no way to keep these confidential in the hands of an attacker.\n\n@lianj perhaps you can weigh in?\n\n**Issue 3: repeating messages**\nSSL itself protects against replay of messages on the protocol level, which means replay attacks would not be possible unless you broke SSL. If this were not true, most messages on the internet could be replayed.\n\n**Recommendations to Coinbase:**\n- Use ProGuard: I personally do not believe in obfuscating source because it can always be defeated trivially. For example, hooking system calls and waiting for the API key to appear.\n\nTo wrap up, I completely respect that you are notifying CoinBase about this issue and giving them a chance to fix it. We not only need more security researchers such as yourself, but we also need *responsible* disclosure to make sure we\u2019re protecting users. I really appreciate your efforts here. Regarding disclosure: as a fellow security researcher, I generally believe that responsible disclosure means a minimum of 30 days notice prior to publication and generally slide that window larger depending on the nature of the vulnerability. This is my personal opinion (and the practice of iSEC Partners), but I just wanted to add a datapoint there.\n\nWould love to continue this discussion, perhaps a phone call would be a good idea? Please let me know if I missed anything.\n\nThanks,\n\nPaul",

            "message": "Hi Bryan,\n\nThanks for the prompt response. A couple of clarifications:\n\n1) Cert pinning basically refers to only accepting a SINGLE certificate (or in some cases, a single CA). That\u2019s because the overall CA model is a bit crazy right now. Most devices (browsers, phones, etc) accept anything from any of 1000+ CAs. The concern is that DigiCert (or any of the other 1000+ CAs) could issue a fraudulent certificate for someone like Google and then MITM gmail traffic.\n\nThis hasn\u2019t been seen in the wild (much) but it\u2019s a big enough concern that people are worried. As a result, people started pinning certificates in applications.\n\nIt sounds like Coinbase isn\u2019t doing certificate pinning, but is instead relying on certificates signed by valid root certificates. If that\u2019s true, it means that just being in the middle between the device and the Coinbase endpoint IS NOT enough to view/modify/replay that traffic. You would STILL need a Coinbase certificate signed by a trusted CA. That is pretty hard to do.\n\nWhat you\u2019re doing with Charles essentially tells the device \u201chey, this certificate is a valid root CA\u201d. Without that step, your device wouldn\u2019t trust the presented certificate. You can test this easily: just remove the CharlesProxy cert and see if you can still view the traffic.\n\nIf you could break SSL just by being in the middle, it would mean that the internet is essentially broken. Any time I browse Amazon and purchase something, the traffic is protected by SSL. I\u2019m routing traffic through a lot of network devices. Any of those devices could do whatever they wanted with that traffic. SSL prevents that. If it didn\u2019t, essentially the internet as we know it wouldn\u2019t work.\n\nIn summary, in my opinion, you are talking about a well known weakness in the Certificate Authority model (for example, here is a popular article discussing some of the problems in how things are set up: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/04/11/state_of_ssl_analysis/). This is a weakness in the CA model, and not a weakness in Coinbase itself.\n\n2) I don\u2019t have enough data here, but I believe this would be hard to exploit in practice. The credential that\u2019s hardcoded would allow a malicious app to pretend to be the CoinBase app (true). But, in order to get a credential, you still need the user\u2019s credentials.\n\nTo me, the credentials aren\u2019t a real barrier here. I could just as easily create a fake coinbase app that didn\u2019t have the actual coinbase credentials and still phish your credentials. I\u2019d then just forward those credentials to the web API and validate them. The availability of the credentials in this case don\u2019t really seem to add anything to this attack, but please let me know if I\u2019m misunderstanding you. Oauth is near and dear to me and I\u2019ve thought about this stuff quite a bit: https://www.isecpartners.com/media/11683/isec-creating_safer_oauth_experience.pdf\n\n3) What\u2019s actually happening in Charles is that it establishes a valid SSL connection with Coinbase, and with your device. It can do that because you told the device to explicitly trust that certificate. So, when you\u2019re \u201creplaying\u201d a message, you\u2019re doing that at network layer 7. It\u2019s \u201creplayed\u201d in the same way that you just performed the action again. Because of SSL, an attacker who is just listening on the wire, wouldn\u2019t be able to modify/see the data. They\u2019d just see the encrypted bits. Those encrypted bits have replay protections on them. So, I can\u2019t just record encrypted bits and send them again, because the protocol will prevent it.\n\nThe only way you can replay messages is if you break SSL. You can see what it looks like without MITM by installing Wireshark, which lets you see the actual traffic on the wire (will look like a bunch of binary data).\n\nIn summary: in my opinion, your findings are:\n\n- Coinbase doesn\u2019t use certificate pinning. This means they are relying on the CA trust model, which is fragile. Of course, almost all web apps and mobile apps rely on the same thing. In order to exploit this, you would have to have a Coinbase certificate signed by a valid CA trusted by the device AND be present on the network between the app and the Coinbase servers.\n\n- Coinbase hardcodes API keys in their application, which is available publicly. Those keys could be used to spoof the Coinbase app to the resource server. You may have to get creative here in terms of how you think this would uniquely help an attack.\n\nThanks,\n\nPaul",

Last night I took another look at your Android application and found some disturbing vulnerabilities that could allow for a user&#39;s account to be hijacked. Fortunately, they are very easy to resolve. Below I have outlined the issue, gave some recommendations, and attached some screenshots.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Coinbase for Android Security Flaws:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The application does not perform any SSL certificate verification.</li>\n<li>The API design does not prevent request tampering or replays.</li>\n<li>The consumer id and secret of the app is widely available.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Potential for damage:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Without implementing your own SSL certificate validation in the Coinbase app, a &quot;man in the middle&quot; can sniff and alter communication between the application and Coinbase API. A malicious hacker could then use this to violate user privacy as well as take advantage of the other two flaws listed. Worse, an attacker could steal the access token provided in network responses and have full API access to the user&#39;s Coinbase account using the widely available Coinbase Android consumer id and secret.</li>\n<li>Because requests are neither adequately protected by SSL, nor are they signed, an attacker could repeat or tamper with requests. For example, an attacker could repeat requests to buy bitcoin, sell bitcoin, or send bitcoin requests from the app to either empty their associated bank account, sell bitcoins needed by the user, or repeat a transfer bitcoins to another account. Not only can transactions be repeated, they can be modified in transit. So, for example, an attacker could change the recipient (and/or amount) of a transaction request.</li>\n<li>The consumer id and secret exposure means that their is no trusted secret between the Coinbase Android app and the Coinbase API. This means any program could make requests to the Coinbase API pretending to be the Coinbase Android app. You would not be able to block the abuser of the Coinbase API without disabling the Coinbase Android app until a new build with a new consumer id and secret was distributed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>How to establish the man in the middle attack on Android</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Set up a proxy server that the Android device will route traffic through.

Worse, an attacker could steal the access token provided in network responses and have full API access to the user's Coinbase account using the widely available Coinbase Android consumer id and secret.\r\n2. Because requests are neither adequately protected by SSL, nor are they signed, an attacker could repeat or tamper with requests. For example, an attacker could repeat requests to buy bitcoin, sell bitcoin, or send bitcoin requests from the app to either empty their associated bank account, sell bitcoins needed by the user, or repeat a transfer bitcoins to another account. Not only can transactions be repeated, they can be modified in transit. So, for example, an attacker could change the recipient (and/or amount) of a transaction request.\r\n3. The consumer id and secret exposure means that their is no trusted secret between the Coinbase Android app and the Coinbase API. This means any program could make requests to the Coinbase API pretending to be the Coinbase Android app. You would not be able to block the abuser of the Coinbase API without disabling the Coinbase Android app until a new build with a new consumer id and secret was distributed.\r\n\r\n**How to establish the man in the middle attack on Android**\r\n\r\n1. Set up a proxy server that the Android device will route traffic through. I use www.charlesproxy.com for this.\r\n2. Install the SSL certificate on the device that the proxy will present as Coinbase's SSL certificate to it's clients. (www.charlesproxy.com/charles.crt)\r\n3. Configure your device to point it's traffic through Charles.\r\n4. Enable SSL \r\n5. View, repeat, and modify requests in Charles Proxy.\r\n\r\n**Availability of the Consumer Id and Secret**\r\n\r\n1. It is publicly available in the GitHub repository. (https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-android/blob/bc6a03229416736acc2ea6bc2fb13f55f7029751/coinbase-android/src/com/coinbase/api/LoginManager.java#L49)\r\n2. It is visible in many requests made by the device when monitoring requests during the man in the middle attack.\r\n\r\n**Recommendations:**\r\n\r\n1. Read the Android Documentation on SSL. \r\n2. Sign OAuth requests and use nonces. See Twitter's documentation for an example. https://dev.twitter.com/docs/auth/creating-signature\r\n3. Change your consumer id and secret and keep them confidential. There is no need to ever send the consumer secret if requests are signed using it.\r\n4. Based on the [available source code](https://github.com/coinbase/coinbase-android), I see that ProGuard is not being used. I highly recommend it both to obfuscate your compiled code and for some of the optimizations available.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how much time you may need to resolve these issue as I would like to publish this on my own blog soon (~3 weeks). If you have any questions, I would be more than happy to answer any questions and walk your developers through the issues.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\nBryan Stern",
