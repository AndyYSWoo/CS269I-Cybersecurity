However, there were other ways we were able to resolve this by routing requests for unknown domains differently, and now serve 404s for these subdomains.\n\nA few more details about the cause and solutions:\n\n* For the subdomain in question, this was caused by a combination of how were routing requests to unknown domains and how we served static websites.\n* The basic issue was that our servers used our `{REDACTED}.data.gov` domain as a fallback for any unknown domain requests routed to us. So if a request came in for particular subdomains, we would end up treating it sort of like a request to `https://{REDACTED}.data.gov`. Since we proxied our home page requests to the same host where `{REDACTED}.data.gov`'s static site is currently hosted, and we passed along the original HTTP Host header for these unknown domains, it meant that the host would respond as if that unknown domain had been accessed directly on that host.
