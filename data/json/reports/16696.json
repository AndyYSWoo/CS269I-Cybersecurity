This feature removes any security with SMS and also allows hackers to reset/reinstall 2FA applications like Authy since SMS is used to sync.\r\n\r\nI believe the hackers switched my Coinbase account from using Authy to just simple SMS codes.  I saw two authentication code text messages on my phone for the two fraudulent bitcoin purchases of $666.28 and $333.17 to max out the $1,000 daily limit.  I did not use that method before and am shocked that the account did not have any delay/freeze on funds after such a change.  \r\n\r\nOther bitcoin businesses range from freezing the account as soon as the 2FA is altered to having a day delay on all withdrawals as standard policy.\r\n\r\nI am out $1,000 and would like to know why Coinbase does not give their users the ability to protect themselves more when 1FA is breached and 2FA is being altered.\r\n\r\n-Bill  ",
