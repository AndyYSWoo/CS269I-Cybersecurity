It will be long paragraph I'm sorry about that. By the way I will share my account details with you, so you can access my account without 2FA(I mean you will bypass it.)\n\nIn this scenario hacker has access to victim's e-mail account. Hacker resets password and sets a new password, but when hacker tries to login, two factor authentication system doesnt let hacker in because hacker doesnt have access victim's phone so he couldnt be able to enter 2FA key.\n\nBy the way you need to understand what 2FA is for. It is a second layer of security. The point of it is when hackers get the email account, it is not even enough because 2FA is enabled as a default settings in this website. Hacker needs to know what is the 2FA key but he cant know because he doesnt have access victim's phone. SO HACKER DOESNT LOGIN EVEN HE HAS ACCESS EMAILS, BECAUSE HE STILL NEEDS 2FA KEY.\n\nFor more info; http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/two-factor-authentication\n\nBut 2FA can be bypass with vulnerability that I've found. Firstly every account has confirmation mail to create account. IT IS A MUST. Hacker can reach the activation link because he has access to email account.\n\nHere is my activation link; https://idp.staging.login.gov/sign_up/email/confirm?_request_id=&confirmation_token=1wzjBaAyfcVnS5iWgmxq\n\nWhen you enter it looks like it doesnt work, but it does actually. The confirmation mail says \"This link will expire in 24 hours.\" But it doesnt expire. I can use to create new password with SAME TOKEN (which doesnt expire in 24 hours). By the way I use the same token in the video, this token created aprox. 48 hours ago and I used it multiple times( You can see it in the video.)\n\nThis is where the whole point starts;\n\nhttps://idp.staging.login.gov/sign_up/enter_password?confirmation_token=1wzjBaAyfcVnS5iWgmxq&request_id=\n\nYou can use this link to create new password and login directly without 2FA key needed. THIS IS THE VULNERABILITY. You can access my account directly with vulnerable link.\n\nJust try to create a new password, you will login directly and you can see the screen that says PHONE CONFIRMED row.\n\nAfter that please sign out and try to login with my account (email : mustafakemal.can@stu.bahcesehir.edu.tr) in normal ways with password that you created via vulnerable link, you'll see 2FA screen that says you need to enter 2FA key to access this account. But when you use vulnerable link, you doesnt have to enter 2FA key, because you've already bypassed it.\n\nI'm sorry again because it is too long but I need to explain whole scenario.
