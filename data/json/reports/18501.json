The server does not update or change this cookie in the response after authenticating the victim and assigns the same value back in the response.  \n\nBut, since the attacker already has that value with him, he can use it on a different workstation and hijack a victim's account. Right? This is how a normal Session Fixation attack would work.\n\nNow, for this issue reported here (slightly different version):\n\nI further contemplated as to how an attacker can possibly hijack a user's session. It seems to me that the exploitability is difficult indeed and not as trivial as a typical session fixation attack. For this attack, an attacker would need 2 conditions:\n1. An existing authenticated victim session. \n2. An ability to somehow strip off the User-Agent header. \n\nFor example, in a corporate setup, if requests from user workstations are being proxied by an upstream proxy, a malicious admin/attacker can potentially create a config rule to strip off all the User-Agent headers for requests going outbound to the WePay server. As a result, all the existing WePay user sessions would be rendered invalid. \n\nThe malicious admin/attacker would then go to the user workstations (assuming they are being called by users to troubleshoot what went wrong), capture the WePay session ID from the browser and come back. He would then disable the above mentioned rule. Now, if the users authenticate to WePay again, that same session cookie would be sent along with a proper User-Agent header and in response, the WePay server would not update/change the session cookie.\n\nBut, since the malicious admin/attacker has that value now, he can then use it on his workstation to hijack a WePay user's session.\n\nPS - I know the above described scenario is hypothetical and not trivial. It assumes a few things which I have not tried in a real world scenario. But, I just wanted to give this attack a little bit of practical exploitation perspective. I hope it makes sense. \n\nThanks,\nAnshuman ",
