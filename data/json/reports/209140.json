    "vulnerability_information": "**Summary:**\n\nHi Hackerone Team,\n\nBefore i reported that email forwarding of private can be enumerated and any user join to private program here #201369 , __but this seems by design__, but now it i found a related issue which can cause a security impact on private program because the email forwarding response of `HackerOne` did not expire after first use.\n\n**Description (Include Impact):**\n\nIf a user __Quits__ to a private program, this user can rejoined without the knowledge of private program owners, also you can check further if the user become Banned it seems that the linked on email still not expire and this can cause security implication if the banned user can rejoined to the program without the knowledge of the program owner, for reproduction steps please see below.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Send a test mail to `\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588` which is private and have email forwarding setup.\n2. Click and follow the link on the email response and you become auto invited to the program (intentional).\n3. __NO NOT__ submit the test report (__means the email link already used, but you did not continue to submit the report, you are now participants to the program__).\n4. Now Quit to the program.\n5. Go to email and click the same link and you can get back without requesting another link (using submit report via email forwarding)\n\n__Link on the email response of forwarding feature should expire after first use__\n{F164319}\n\n### Impact:\n\nWhen the user quits, or if the program owner dicided to remove/banned the user on participating private program, the user should not get back unless the program owners decide to un-banned and the user/researcher gets invited again. \n\n### Mitigation:\n\nThe email forwarding feature should expire after it's first use, do not allow the attacker to reused the link to join to the program.\n\nPlease ask if you need more information.\n\nRegards\nJapz\n",

However, even though this doesn't happen that often, it's likely to become more common given how long our program has been around. Therefor we'll propose a new policy going forward and we'd like your feedback on it. This is not a formal policy yet, once it is, it'll likely be added to our bug bounty program page.\n\n - If the original report was filed in the last 3 months, we will resolve the report and reward the same bounty the duplicate received.\n - If the original report was filed over 3 months ago, but less than a year ago, resolve the report and no bounty will be awarded.\n - If the original report was filed over a year ago, nothing will be changed.\n\nThis report was filed over a year ago, so according to the new policy this report would've remained closed as Informative. Because we didn't have such policy, we're closing this our as resolved. In this particular case, I do agree with @asuka's assessment. Our application does not have the ability to disable the Email Forwarding feature and so @asuka's call was correct. Because we don't have a process for this, we cannot assume that people would've cancelled the outstanding invitations, which is why we decided to get a fix out for #331691.\n\nThanks again for bringing this to our attention. Let me know what you think. Good luck and happy hacking!",
