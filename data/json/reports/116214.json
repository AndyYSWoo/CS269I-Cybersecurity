I (still) truly think this needs a patch.<br>\nAnd, yes, this can be done by a patch/fix within 40 minutes.</p>\n\n<p>You can do/solve this by simply &#39;creating&#39; your own subscription form (wich is supported by MailChimp), then sanatize the inputs you need to protect.<br>\nOther words? Use MailChimps customized options to set-up your own &#39;input-fields&#39;. More info about that here: <a title=\"http://uhurunetwork.com/customizing-mailchimp-form-design/\" href=\"/redirect?signature=a8f42fad2889696dba9fbc5455d7ab84476b7222&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fuhurunetwork.com%2Fcustomizing-mailchimp-form-design%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>http://uhurunetwork.com/customizing-mailchimp-form-design/</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a> &amp; <a title=\"http://designshack.net/articles/css/custom-mailchimp-email-signup-form/\" href=\"/redirect?signature=e8f311d0e30d720b14aff05121d6d7daffde9166&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fdesignshack.net%2Farticles%2Fcss%2Fcustom-mailchimp-email-signup-form%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>http://designshack.net/articles/css/custom-mailchimp-email-signup-form/</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a></p>\n\n<p>Daniel cid, it would be great to have some response regarding this report. Otherwise please close it as &#39;<strong>won&#39;t fix</strong>&#39;, then set it &#39;Public&#39;. Other words, if <em>closed</em>, <strong>i request Public Disclosure</strong> of this report, that would be transparant enough? Especially for a &#39;security company&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>Sincerely,<br>\n<em>Roy jansen</em></p>\n",
