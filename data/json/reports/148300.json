This is to prevent something like a package doing:\n\n`file_get_contents(URL::to($_REQUEST['url']))`\n\nOn a site without a canonical url, if the user passes \"/etc/passwd\" and the url resolver returns \"/etc/passwd\" instead of \"http://canonical.com/etc/passwd\" your site will include something you don't want it to.\n\nThat said, that is probably a bit far fetched.
