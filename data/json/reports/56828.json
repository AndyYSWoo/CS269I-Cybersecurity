This server has the following version:\r\n\r\n    SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_5.9p1 Debian-5ubuntu1.1\r\n\r\nThe webhook URL used to gain this information was ```http://[::1]:22/```, which produces the following output:\r\n\r\n``` \r\nError: Incorrect response to challenge. We didn't receive the expected response vLU7VauagR860z2P2sNTZkSNFJvdjt3zJ-qfZP1yIGU. See the actual response body we received below.\r\n\r\nRequest:\r\nGET http://[::1]:22/?challenge=vLU7VauagR860z2P2sNTZkSNFJvdjt3zJ-qfZP1yIGU\r\n\r\nResponse:\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nServer: squid/3.1.19\r\nConnection: close\r\nX-Transformed-From: HTTP/0.9\r\nDate: Fri, 17 Apr 2015 02:23:10 GMT\r\nMime-Version: 1.0\r\n\r\nResponse Body (First 256 bytes):\r\nSSH-2.0-OpenSSH_5.9p1 Debian-5ubuntu1.1\\r\\nProtocol mismatch.\\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother URL that gives same result is ```http://testing6.allthethings.co.nz:22/``` where ```testing6.allthethings.co.nz``` is a domain that only has a AAAA record pointing to ::1 (localhost)\r\n\r\nI've tested using HTTP redirects (302's), but they fail, and domains that point to IPv4 localhost (```testing.allthethings.co.nz```) which also fail.\r\n\r\nWith this vulnerability, I am able to gain information about the local system, and potentially machines in neighbor networks to that machine. I can also send GET requests to a service running on any port on a system accessible to this machine. This could potentially cause damage to those internal applications. For examples of applications that may be vulnerable, please check out [this reference](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v1TkWZtrhzRLy0bYXBcdLUedXGb9njTNIJXa3u9akHM/edit) which is now a bit outdated, but shows that there is a non zero amount of applications that may be vulnerable.\r\n\r\nNote that I could spend more time trying to figure out what applications there may be that are vulnerable on your internal network, but I feel this would go outside the intended scope of the bounty brief.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need any more clarification or if you have questions. I'm happy to provide a screencast and/or screenshots of the vulnerability if needed.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nHugh\r\n    ",
