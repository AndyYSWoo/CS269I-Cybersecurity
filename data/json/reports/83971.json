To disallow TRACE and TRACK methods through URLScan, first remove &#39;TRACK&#39;, &#39;TRACE&#39; methods from the &#39;AllowVerbs&#39; section and add them to the &#39;DenyVerbs&#39; section.

Therefore, if URLScan is used to specfically block the TRACE method, the TRACK method should also be added to the filter.\r\nURLScan uses the 'urlscan.ini' configuration file, usually in \\System32\\InetSrv\\URLScan directory. In that, we have two sections - AllowVerbs and DenyVerbs. The former is used if the UseAllowVerbs variable is set to 1, else (if its set to 0), the DenyVerbs are used. Clearly, either can be used, depending on whether we want a Default-Deny-Explicit-Allow or a Default-Allow-Explicit-Deny policy. To disallow TRACE and TRACK methods through URLScan, first remove 'TRACK', 'TRACE' methods from the 'AllowVerbs' section and add them to the 'DenyVerbs' section. With this, URLScan will disallow all 'TRACE' and 'TRACK' methods, and generate an error page for all requests using that method. To enable the changes, restart the 'World Wide Web Publishing Service' from the 'Services' Control Panel item.\r\n\r\nRESULTS:\r\n\r\n    TRACE /QUALYS12680.html HTTP/1.1\r\n    Host: test1.owncloud.com:443\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n    Date: Fri, 21 Aug 2015 10:57:04 GMT\r\n    Server: Apache/2.2.22 (Linux/SUSE)\r\n    Connection: close\r\n    Transfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n    Content-Type: message/http\r\n    \r\n    TRACE /QUALYS12680.html HTTP/1.1\r\n    Host: test1.owncloud.com:443\r\n    Connection: Keep-Alive",
