As such, I don't feel that they are similar at all, as all you know is that a report ID was filed at a certain time, but no additional info about it. There's nothing sensitive about that particular information, and while perhaps it could be used to gain some better insights into how researchers work, it doesn't actually leak specific information about the reports, the teams, or even the reporters. #127620 is focused solely on metadata that should not be public yet.\n\nAs there is no security issue here, I am closing this as N/A. We look forward to future reports from you concerning actionable security vulnerabilities. Happy hacking!",
