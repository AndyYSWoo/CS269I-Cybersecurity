    "vulnerability_information": "The dangerous bug reporting template\n=============================\n\nThe github bug reporting template for owncloud's server and some apps contains this:\n\n```\nThe content of config/config.php:\n\nIf you have access to your command line run e.g.:\nsudo -u www-data php occ config:list system\nfrom within your instance's installation folder\n\nor \n\nInsert your config.php content here\n(Without the database password, passwordsalt and secret)\n```\n\nThis is obviously very problematic. From the wording and instructions it is very likely that users will do the wrong thing: Paste the config.php without removing all passwords, for various reasons:\n\nIt's likely to assume that many users won't read the detailed instructions and will just do the first thing they're told: Insert the content of config/config.php.\nThe instruction with sudo and www-data is specific to certain server configurations and may not work everywhere, thus it will fail for some users who will try the next option, namely inserting config.php directly.\nThe instruction \"Without the database password, passwordsalt and secret\" is incomplete. There can be more sensitive fields in the config file, e.g. \"mail_smtppassword\".\nNot surprisingly users misread these instructions and paste sensitive passwords. See e.g.:\nhttps://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/9066\nhttps://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/9458\nhttps://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/9764\nhttps://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/9734\nhttps://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/20910\nhttps://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/14240\n(list is incomplete!)\n\n\nProposed remediation\n=================\n\nI think it's necessary that you search all existing bug reports that have been created with this template for sensitive passwords and edit them to remove the password. It is probably also appropriate to inform the affected users.\n\nI also believe encouraging users to paste a config file with passwords is inherently dangerous and no amount of warnings will prevent all users from making mistakes. In general I think it should always be a guiding principle of software design to make it hard for users to make security mistakes.\n\nThere are various ways the situation could be improved, this is what I could think of:\n\nProvide a way in the webinterface to let users view a version of the config file where all sensitive values are removed (like the command line instruction, but more accessible).\nChange the instruction and avoid all references to pasting the raw config file content. If there's a need to get the config file in rare circumstances a developer could ask a bug reporter for it, ideally via private channels and only post a manually vetted version to the bug report.\nLeakage of instanceid\n\nOne additional observation: The \"occ config:list\" command removes dbpassword, secret and mail_smtppassword, but it leaves instanceid intact. I'm not familiar enough to judge how sensitive this value is, but it seems to be an unique identifier for each owncloud installation. It would probably be wise to remove that, too.\n\nAffects owncloud and nextcloud\n========================\n\nThis issue affects the development of both owncloud and nextcloud in the same way. Thus I will report it to both projects.",

From the wording and instructions it is very likely that users will do the wrong thing: Paste the config.php without removing all passwords, for various reasons:</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s likely to assume that many users won&#39;t read the detailed instructions and will just do the first thing they&#39;re told: Insert the content of config/config.php.<br>\nThe instruction with sudo and www-data is specific to certain server configurations and may not work everywhere, thus it will fail for some users who will try the next option, namely inserting config.php directly.<br>\nThe instruction &quot;Without the database password, passwordsalt and secret&quot; is incomplete. There can be more sensitive fields in the config file, e.g. &quot;mail_smtppassword&quot;.<br>\nNot surprisingly users misread these instructions and paste sensitive passwords.

It is probably also appropriate to inform the affected users.</p>\n\n<p>I also believe encouraging users to paste a config file with passwords is inherently dangerous and no amount of warnings will prevent all users from making mistakes. In general I think it should always be a guiding principle of software design to make it hard for users to make security mistakes.</p>\n\n<p>There are various ways the situation could be improved, this is what I could think of:</p>\n\n<p>Provide a way in the webinterface to let users view a version of the config file where all sensitive values are removed (like the command line instruction, but more accessible).<br>\nChange the instruction and avoid all references to pasting the raw config file content. If there&#39;s a need to get the config file in rare circumstances a developer could ask a bug reporter for it, ideally via private channels and only post a manually vetted version to the bug report.<br>\nLeakage of instanceid</p>\n\n<p>One additional observation: The &quot;occ config:list&quot; command removes dbpassword, secret and mail_smtppassword, but it leaves instanceid intact. I&#39;m not familiar enough to judge how sensitive this value is, but it seems to be an unique identifier for each owncloud installation. It would probably be wise to remove that, too.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"affects-owncloud-and-nextcloud\">Affects owncloud and nextcloud</h1>\n\n<p>This issue affects the development of both owncloud and nextcloud in the same way. Thus I will report it to both projects.</p>\n",
