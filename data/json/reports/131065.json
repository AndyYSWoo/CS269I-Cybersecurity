However, I can&#39;t find enough data about what you&#39;re claiming, most especially for ciphers related to SSH. Can you tell me more?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Regarding the SSL ciphers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>As far I know, while doing a MITM attack, you need to force the client to establish a new tunnel between him and you, then you&#39;ll create a new one with the remote server. Being able to modify the content &quot;on the wire&quot; (without making the target establish a new tunnel) seems to be more related to implementation problems (malleability and no authentication of the data, <a href=\"/redirect?signature=f5aff591848c851cfd763963b762a5894af6b004&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnonce-disrespect%2Fnonce-disrespect\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>weird implementations</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a> or <a href=\"/redirect?signature=8a1b5b5a8e5e5f50e4ef551a0e53221c68929f4d&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcrypto.stackexchange.com%2Fa%2F1082\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>versions of the protocol which we are not using</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a>).

Furthermore, we are running nginx, which seems to be less disposed to behave the same way than Apache (aka. not handling any new connexion) when being attacked with this method. In addition, we are not receiving reports about &quot;Network-level DoS&quot;. </li>\n</ul>\n",
