Particularly I am not asking for anything that is not fair, I consider that if hackerone decides to change its policy must do it after resolving correctly all the open reports. \n\nAs for report # 217358 at no time says that hackerone will reduce payments for a particular report, it only says that they will consider payments only for critical issues affecting info.hacker.one, this report is an excellent example of them, affects directly to `` Info.hacker.one`` in critical way. At no time it is explicitly stated that h1 will reduce the amount in future similar reports.\n\nI think I am not asking for anything that is not logical and correct. Anyway HackerOne has the last word, and I am more than grateful to the whole H1 team and this awesome platform, Whatever will decided, sure to be fine.\n\nKind Regards,\n@ak1t4\n\n\n", 
            "markdown_message": "<p>Hi <a href=\"/reed\">@reed</a>, thanks your reply:</p>\n\n<p>I totally understand what you are saying,  in that case, HackerOne needs to reconsidere his policy, like example to change it, and deleting <code>info.hacker.one</code> domain from his scope. If something does not go as one wish, you can not speculate on it, at most you can learn from that situation and continue.. I think this situation is the prime example of it. Particularly I am not asking for anything that is not fair, I consider that if hackerone decides to change its policy must do it after resolving correctly all the open reports. </p>\n\n<p>As for report # 217358 at no time says that hackerone will reduce payments for a particular report, it only says that they will consider payments only for critical issues affecting info.hacker.one, this report is an excellent example of them, affects directly to <code>Info.hacker.one</code> in critical way. At no time it is explicitly stated that h1 will reduce the amount in future similar reports.</p>\n\n<p>I think I am not asking for anything that is not logical and correct. Anyway HackerOne has the last word, and I am more than grateful to the whole H1 team and this awesome platform, Whatever will decided, sure to be fine.</p>\n\n<p>Kind Regards,<br>\n<a href=\"/ak1t4\">@ak1t4</a></p>\n",
