    "vulnerability_information": "**Summary**\n\nIt was found that although the `referrer-policy` header for https://hackerone.com/hacktivity was set to `strict-origin-when-cross-origin\n`, a request to https://www.hackerone.com/blog contains full url path of the the hackivity page as the `referer` header eg. `https://hackerone.com/hacktivity?sort_type=popular&filter=type%3Aall&page=1&range=forever`. The `www.hackerone.com` being hosted on a third party, this can lead to private url information being passed to third party.    \n\n**Description**\n\nA `referrer policy` header is set on all pages including **/hacktivity** to `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` wherein the full path of the url will be set as the `referer` only if the request is `same-origin`. But it was seen that although this header being set at /hacktivity page, it still sends a full url to an different origin ie `www.hackerone.com`. www.hackerone.com being hosted on a third party and also even after setting the referrer-policy header the hacktivity page sends full url in the referer header. This is something serious here. \n\n\n**Steps to reproduce**\n\n+ Sign-in to hackerone.\n+ Start a web debugging proxy like burp to capture the request.\n+ Click on hacktivity tab -  https://hackerone.com/hacktivity. The url will contain filter parameters that are set default eg `https://hackerone.com/hacktivity?sort_type=popular&filter=type%3Aall&page=1&range=forever`. This is the `popular` hackivity page with default filters. capture the request and response. The response looks like this.\n\n\n```:status:                           200\ndate:                              Tue, 12 Dec 2017 05:42:21 GMT\ncontent-type:                      text/html; charset=utf-8\ncache-control:                     private, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate\ncontent-disposition:               inline; filename=\"response.html\"\nx-request-id:                      d7905553-8780-4731-93b8-021b4761817a\nset-cookie:                        __Host-session=<Redacted value>; path=/; secure; HttpOnly\nstrict-transport-security:         max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload\nexpect-ct:                         enforce, max-age=86400\ncontent-security-policy:           <Redacted as long for clarity>\nreferrer-policy:                   strict-origin-when-cross-origin\nx-content-type-options:            nosniff\nx-download-options:                noopen\nx-frame-options:                   DENY\nx-permitted-cross-domain-policies: none\nx-xss-protection:                  1; mode=block\nserver:                            cloudflare-nginx\ncf-ray:                            3cbe5c199a952db5-BOM\ncontent-encoding:                  gzip```\n\n**Note** - If we look at the `referrer-policy:` header it is set to `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`.\n\n+ Click on `blog` link at the bottom of the page and capture the request. The request looks like this. \n\n```:method:         GET\n:path:           /blog\n:authority:      www.hackerone.com\n:scheme:         https\nuser-agent:      Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; rv:46.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/46.0\naccept:          text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\naccept-language: en-US,en;q=0.5\naccept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nreferer:         https://hackerone.com/hacktivity?sort_type=popular&filter=type%3Aall&page=1&range=forever\ncookie:          <Redacted cookie values>\nif-none-match:   \"1513035467\"```\n\n**Note** - The `referer:` header contains the full url path inspite of referrer-policy header being set to strict-origin-when-cross-origin. This is a security violation as www.hackerone.com is not a `same-origin` and also hosted on a third party.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe hackivity url does not contain any private or hidden paths. But even after a strict header being set, this behaviour is a threat as it violates the policy. If a header is set, the policy must be followed and enforced. This is to be ensured for better security.",

The <code>www.hackerone.com</code> being hosted on a third party, this can lead to private url information being passed to third party.    </p>\n\n<p><strong>Description</strong></p>\n\n<p>A <code>referrer policy</code> header is set on all pages including <strong>/hacktivity</strong> to <code>strict-origin-when-cross-origin</code> wherein the full path of the url will be set as the <code>referer</code> only if the request is <code>same-origin</code>. But it was seen that although this header being set at /hacktivity page, it still sends a full url to an different origin ie <code>www.hackerone.com</code>. <a href=\"/redirect?signature=5d6566533d7b4f3feaea01437f23f8e72a3f4836&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hackerone.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>www.hackerone.com</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a> being hosted on a third party and also even after setting the referrer-policy header the hacktivity page sends full url in the referer header. This is something serious here. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Steps to reproduce</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Sign-in to hackerone.</li>\n<li>Start a web debugging proxy like burp to capture the request.</li>\n<li>Click on hacktivity tab -  <a title=\"https://hackerone.com/hacktivity\" href=\"https://hackerone.com/hacktivity\">https://hackerone.com/hacktivity</a>. The url will contain filter parameters that are set default eg <code>https://hackerone.com/hacktivity?sort_type=popular&amp;filter=type%3Aall&amp;page=1&amp;range=forever</code>. This is the <code>popular</code> hackivity page with default filters. capture the request and response. The response looks like this.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><code>:status:                           200<br>\ndate:                              Tue, 12 Dec 2017 05:42:21 GMT<br>\ncontent-type:                      text/html; charset=utf-8<br>\ncache-control:                     private, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate<br>\ncontent-disposition:               inline; filename=&quot;response.html&quot;<br>\nx-request-id:                      d7905553-8780-4731-93b8-021b4761817a<br>\nset-cookie:                        __Host-session=&lt;Redacted value&gt;; path=/; secure; HttpOnly<br>\nstrict-transport-security:         max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload<br>\nexpect-ct:                         enforce, max-age=86400<br>\ncontent-security-policy:           &lt;Redacted as long for clarity&gt;<br>\nreferrer-policy:                   strict-origin-when-cross-origin<br>\nx-content-type-options:            nosniff<br>\nx-download-options:                noopen<br>\nx-frame-options:                   DENY<br>\nx-permitted-cross-domain-policies: none<br>\nx-xss-protection:                  1; mode=block<br>\nserver:                            cloudflare-nginx<br>\ncf-ray:                            3cbe5c199a952db5-BOM<br>\ncontent-encoding:                  gzip</code></p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong> - If we look at the <code>referrer-policy:</code> header it is set to <code>strict-origin-when-cross-origin</code>.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Click on <code>blog</code> link at the bottom of the page and capture the request.

But even after a strict header being set, this behaviour is a threat as it violates the policy. If a header is set, the policy must be followed and enforced. This is to be ensured for better security.</p>\n",
