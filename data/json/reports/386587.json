    "vulnerability_information": "**Summary:** A third party attacking site can fake UI data - markets, categories and other\n\n**Description:** A third party site can include a hidden iframe which can override \"augur-node\" configuration variable of a running augur application. This variable is persisted in localStorage. In the case of browser page reload (user action or browser/OS crash), the normal \"augur-node\" websockets endpoint will be replaced with the provided by attacker so that all the markets data, addresses and transactions can be masqueraded. \n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. Start Augur application\n  1. Open application\n  1. Click on \"markets\" tab\n  1. Start web socket server on port 8081 (different from the Augur one)\n  1. Open HTML page with iframe which loads Augur's initial page with \"augur-node\" parameter overwritten by new value, for example 192.168.31.204:8081 in my test case\n  1. Observe \"Application\" data tab in developer tools, the augur-node variable is set to new value: 192.168.31.204:8081\n  1. Reload opened application (simulating user occasional reload or browser crash, or a user opening Augur app form bookmarks )\n  1. Observe the log console of the web sockets server: you can see requests for categories, market data etc\n  1. Observe the Augur application UI - no data is provided as the fake web sockets server has been called, we only need to add implementation and return fake data there to get user misdirected\n\n## Impact: Can lead to fund and reputation loss\n\nI also mentioned the danger of it in https://hackerone.com/bugs?subject=user&report_id=385125\n\nAugur application should not be possible to load in an iframe and manipulate user's settings. For example, Gmail doesn't allow this.\n\nAlso, storing important configuration data in localStorage is a very bad practice\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\n  * HTML page implementing iframe which sets wrong data\n  * server.js Simple web socket in node\n\n## Impact\n\nCan lead to fund and reputation loss\n\nI also mentioned the danger of it in https://hackerone.com/bugs?subject=user&report_id=385125",

Augur App servers a webpage onto localhost:8080 and does not protect against serving within frames. You are correct this opens up the frame-jacking attack. I believe fixing this is the most important action item and can be donr quite simply using: https://github.com/helmetjs/frameguard. We've filed and issue to complete this task ASAP: https://app.clubhouse.io/augur/story/14538/patch-augur-app-express-server-with-helmet\n\n2. Augur UI stores configuration in localStorage. This is an unfortunate issue because we have very few options for passing in configuration via IPFS, but it also opens up a security vulnerabuility because anyone accessing ipfs via ipfs.io can read/write to the same localstorage namespace. This is a known issue (from the time of design) and we're offering an option for people to clear their localstorage configuration to mitigate the issue.\n\n3. Augur Node does not allow configurable WS origins. I do agree this is an improvement for anyone running a public AN, but is less of a security concern than a concern given AN's execution model. I believe we should add configurable WS origins options and set it to be `localhost` within augur-app.\n\nSince (1) is the real data-security vulnerability here (as [2] is just a risk of running off a public IPFS endpoint and is documented) -- I say we tackle that first and then file issues for improvements around 2 and 3, both in documentation and configuration.", 
            "markdown_message": "<p>Hello!</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your submission! There are a few different issues in this post so I am going to address them separately here.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Augur App servers a webpage onto localhost:8080 and does not protect against serving within frames. You are correct this opens up the frame-jacking attack. I believe fixing this is the most important action item and can be donr quite simply using: <a title=\"https://github.com/helmetjs/frameguard\" href=\"/redirect?signature=b60045905db6aef6532b9d8e73a80caf1c991831&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhelmetjs%2Fframeguard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://github.com/helmetjs/frameguard</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a>. We&#39;ve filed and issue to complete this task ASAP: <a title=\"https://app.clubhouse.io/augur/story/14538/patch-augur-app-express-server-with-helmet\" href=\"/redirect?signature=25e82715d80e6583d2420a7e23bc5b8b78d7440b&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.clubhouse.io%2Faugur%2Fstory%2F14538%2Fpatch-augur-app-express-server-with-helmet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://app.clubhouse.io/augur/story/14538/patch-augur-app-express-server-with-helmet</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a></p></li>\n<li><p>Augur UI stores configuration in localStorage. This is an unfortunate issue because we have very few options for passing in configuration via IPFS, but it also opens up a security vulnerabuility because anyone accessing ipfs via ipfs.io can read/write to the same localstorage namespace. This is a known issue (from the time of design) and we&#39;re offering an option for people to clear their localstorage configuration to mitigate the issue.</p></li>\n<li><p>Augur Node does not allow configurable WS origins. I do agree this is an improvement for anyone running a public AN, but is less of a security concern than a concern given AN&#39;s execution model. I believe we should add configurable WS origins options and set it to be <code>localhost</code> within augur-app.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Since (1) is the real data-security vulnerability here (as [2] is just a risk of running off a public IPFS endpoint and is documented) -- I say we tackle that first and then file issues for improvements around 2 and 3, both in documentation and configuration.</p>\n",

This variable is persisted in localStorage. In the case of browser page reload (user action or browser/OS crash), the normal &quot;augur-node&quot; websockets endpoint will be replaced with the provided by attacker so that all the markets data, addresses and transactions can be masqueraded. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"steps-to-reproduce\">Steps To Reproduce:</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Start Augur application</li>\n<li>Open application</li>\n<li>Click on &quot;markets&quot; tab</li>\n<li>Start web socket server on port 8081 (different from the Augur one)</li>\n<li>Open HTML page with iframe which loads Augur&#39;s initial page with &quot;augur-node&quot; parameter overwritten by new value, for example 192.168.31.204:8081 in my test case</li>\n<li>Observe &quot;Application&quot; data tab in developer tools, the augur-node variable is set to new value: 192.168.31.204:8081</li>\n<li>Reload opened application (simulating user occasional reload or browser crash, or a user opening Augur app form bookmarks )</li>\n<li>Observe the log console of the web sockets server: you can see requests for categories, market data etc</li>\n<li>Observe the Augur application UI - no data is provided as the fake web sockets server has been called, we only need to add implementation and return fake data there to get user misdirected</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"impact-can-lead-to-fund-and-reputation-loss\">Impact: Can lead to fund and reputation loss</h2>\n\n<p>I also mentioned the danger of it in <a title=\"https://hackerone.com/bugs?subject=user&amp;report_id=385125\" href=\"https://hackerone.com/bugs?subject=user&amp;report_id=385125\">https://hackerone.com/bugs?subject=user&amp;report_id=385125</a></p>\n\n<p>Augur application should not be possible to load in an iframe and manipulate user&#39;s settings.
