This is not something you would notice when you use the latest version of modern web browsers such as Google Chrome or Firefox, because legalrobot.com is HSTS preloaded. When a domain is preloaded, non-secure requests for these domains are internally upgraded to HTTPS. However, there are still browsers that either haven&#39;t implemented HSTS preload lists, or don&#39;t have legalrobot.com on their HSTS preload lists (yet).</p>\n\n<p>Take for example Safari on iOS, which doesn&#39;t have legalrobot.com in its HSTS preload list. When you open <a title=\"http://legalrobot.com\" href=\"/redirect?signature=b6a037243f371cf58da473a6d850723ee45ee07d&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Flegalrobot.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>http://legalrobot.com</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a> in Safari and head over to the &#39;Sign in&#39; page you will see that the connection is not upgraded to HTTPS. Moreover, if you enter your username and password, and hit &#39;Sign in&#39;, the form is sent in the clear over a non-secure connection.</p>\n\n<p>Since non-secure requests aren&#39;t upgraded to HTTPS, the user will never receive instructions (via the Strict-Transport-Security header) to set the HSTS &quot;cookie&quot; for &#39;legalrobot.com. Which means a secure connection is not enforce until the first time the requests a resource over HTTPS, because that response will include theStrict-Transport-Security` header.</p>\n\n<p>Steps to reproduce</p>\n\n<p>cURL</p>\n\n<p>Send a HEAD request to <a title=\"http://legalrobot.com\" href=\"/redirect?signature=b6a037243f371cf58da473a6d850723ee45ee07d&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Flegalrobot.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>http://legalrobot.com</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a> curl -I <a title=\"http://legalrobot.com\" href=\"/redirect?signature=b6a037243f371cf58da473a6d850723ee45ee07d&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Flegalrobot.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>http://legalrobot.com</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a>.<br>\nYou will see that the server does not instruct the client to upgrade the connection to HTTPS.

    "vulnerability_information": "Non-secure requests to legalrobot.com/ (e.g. http://www.legalrobot.com/) are not automatically upgraded to HTTPS. This is not something you would notice when you use the latest version of modern web browsers such as Google Chrome or Firefox, because legalrobot.com is HSTS preloaded. When a domain is preloaded, non-secure requests for these domains are internally upgraded to HTTPS. However, there are still browsers that either haven't implemented HSTS preload lists, or don't have legalrobot.com on their HSTS preload lists (yet).\n\nTake for example Safari on iOS, which doesn't have legalrobot.com in its HSTS preload list. When you open http://legalrobot.com in Safari and head over to the 'Sign in' page you will see that the connection is not upgraded to HTTPS. Moreover, if you enter your username and password, and hit 'Sign in', the form is sent in the clear over a non-secure connection.\n\nSince non-secure requests aren't upgraded to HTTPS, the user will never receive instructions (via the Strict-Transport-Security header) to set the HSTS \"cookie\" for 'legalrobot.com.
