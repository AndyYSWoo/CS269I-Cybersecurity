He can then lure other coinbase users to view his app and get redirected or install malicious files by sending them the app URL. \n\nStatus:\nThis appears to be fixed now as other coinbase users are not able to view the app by accessing the URL sent by the original user. They see a 404 Page Not Found error.\n\nIssue # 2:\nOther coinbase users can leave comments/write reviews on the original coinbase user's app even though the app is still being reviewed. \n\nStatus:\nThis appears to be fixed now as other coinbase users are not able to access the app URL sent by the original user. If they can't access the URL, they cannot really leave any review/feedback. \n\nHaving said that, I did not record the request (to write reviews) that I sent earlier to exploit this in the first place. Hence, I could not replay that request to verify that this has been fixed completely. I cannot say for sure if this has been mitigated by making the app URL inaccessible and hence no place to write reviews OR if this has been mitigated by performing authorization checks to ensure that unauthorized users are not allowed to write reviews for applications that have not been published yet.\n \nEither ways, I am not able to reproduce this anymore. But, I would still cross-check to be sure that proper fixes have been implemented.\n\nIssue # 3:\nAfter creating, saving and submitting an app for approval, there is an option to upload screenshots. There did not seem to be any restrictions on the kind of files that can be uploaded. I was able to upload an executable and I got a message saying it was successfully uploaded. I could not verify if the file was really uploaded or not because I believe it will only be visible once it has been approved. But, it did seem that it was successfully uploaded. I am attaching a pic to display this option.\n\nStatus:\nThis does not appear to be fixed. I am still getting a message saying that screenshot has been added when I try to upload files of various extensions. There also doesn't seem to be any sort of file size sanity check. I would make sure I cross-check this again. \n\nPlease let me know if there are any questions.\n\nThanks,\nAnshuman",
