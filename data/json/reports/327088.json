    "vulnerability_information": "**Summary:**\nThe response to www.hackerone.com/PROGRAM.json includes `sla_missed_count` `sla_failed_count` and `researcher_count`. \n\n**Description:**\nViewing the response from a program's json endpoint includes the values for `sla_missed_count`, `sla_failed_count` and `researcher_count`.\n\nWith regards to the SLA metrics, these are not included in the UI on the policy page and hovering over a program indicator just reveals a summary of the information, such as >=1 report has failed the SLA. There is no mention of these values being disclosed in the program settings pages and according to the SLA FAQ docs, only a `summarized version of a program\u2019s response efficiency metric performance [will be displayed] on their hacker facing security page` https://support.hackerone.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005927583-Response-SLAs-on-Security-Pages\n\nWith regards to the researcher count, I'm including this because the information isn't disclosed in the UI when you have a pending invite to a program and I'm not sure why that might be. Nonetheless, viewing the same JSON response includes the `researcher_count`\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Log in\n2. Visit any program and have Burp capture the response\n3. Confirm the bottom of the JSON response includes the SLA information\n\n### Supporting Material/References (Screenshots)\n\n{F273408}\n\n## Impact\n\nThe program settings page nor documentation indicates that SLA misses/fails will be disclosed. This information should be considered sensitive in nature and programs should opt into disclosing it if this is intentional since it reveals a minimum number of security vulnerabilities a program may be addressing (I say may because the SLA violation could be response / triage).\n\nThe researcher count could be considered sensitive in the context of a private invite, revealing how many vulnerabilities have been found by what number of people before having actually accepted an invitation. I recognize this is a stretch but also assume there is a reason this number isn't disclosed before accepting a private invitation.",
