I discovered the endpoint, which allows the attacker conduct the fishing attack to other users and they can pay for attacker's order.\nWhy this can happen? \nOn the site, order id parameter sends to the https://portswigger.net/CCPayment.aspx as POST, but attacker can append it as GET and it will works:\n\nExample:\nhttps://portswigger.net/CCPayment.aspx?id=DD6BE85CDD50DC829C0354F83E5C67\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1) Go to the https://portswigger.net/buy/ and fill the form.\n2) Click \"Confirm details\".\n3) Click \"Pay by credit card\".\n4) Catch the POST request from \u0421\u0421payment.aspx with order id:\n\nPOST /CCPayment.aspx HTTP/1.1\n[...Headers...]\n\nid=05BC4BF36F9BB32E80F4B581BF4859\n\n5) Now append the id as GET parameter. You will have link like https://portswigger.net/CCPayment.aspx?id=05BC4BF36F9BB32E80F4B581BF4859\n6) Now you can conduct phishing attack with this link, and users can pay for your order.",

I discovered the endpoint, which allows the attacker conduct the fishing attack to other users and they can pay for attacker&#39;s order.<br>\nWhy this can happen? <br>\nOn the site, order id parameter sends to the <a title=\"https://portswigger.net/CCPayment.aspx\" href=\"/redirect?signature=37b097a4774757cced4092db182730814538c9c4&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fportswigger.net%2FCCPayment.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://portswigger.net/CCPayment.aspx</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a> as POST, but attacker can append it as GET and it will works:</p>\n\n<p>Example:<br>\n<a title=\"https://portswigger.net/CCPayment.aspx?id=DD6BE85CDD50DC829C0354F83E5C67\" href=\"/redirect?signature=8c95c6e8f8d3041ffdc07e2eecd647c88329cfcd&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fportswigger.net%2FCCPayment.aspx%3Fid%3DDD6BE85CDD50DC829C0354F83E5C67\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://portswigger.net/CCPayment.aspx?id=DD6BE85CDD50DC829C0354F83E5C67</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a></p>\n\n<p>Steps to reproduce:<br>\n1) Go to the <a title=\"https://portswigger.net/buy/\" href=\"/redirect?signature=6c44c8875290b36452fb2c0d66c14814e43cb4d4&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fportswigger.net%2Fbuy%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://portswigger.net/buy/</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a> and fill the form.<br>\n2) Click &quot;Confirm details&quot;.<br>\n3) Click &quot;Pay by credit card&quot;.<br>\n4) Catch the POST request from \u0421\u0421payment.aspx with order id:</p>\n\n<p>POST /CCPayment.aspx HTTP/1.1<br>\n[...Headers...]</p>\n\n<p>id=05BC4BF36F9BB32E80F4B581BF4859</p>\n\n<p>5) Now append the id as GET parameter. You will have link like <a title=\"https://portswigger.net/CCPayment.aspx?id=05BC4BF36F9BB32E80F4B581BF4859\" href=\"/redirect?signature=7dd27743053548b9a11f90d7e789b80f884d064d&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fportswigger.net%2FCCPayment.aspx%3Fid%3D05BC4BF36F9BB32E80F4B581BF4859\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://portswigger.net/CCPayment.aspx?id=05BC4BF36F9BB32E80F4B581BF4859</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a><br>\n6) Now you can conduct phishing attack with this link, and users can pay for your order.</p>\n",
