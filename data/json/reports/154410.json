Suppose staff members comments in it . Now owner of the account limited access to orders , then he won&#39;t be able to access his comments and he won&#39;t be able to modify/delete  his comments. But this can be bypassed and he can still modify and delete his own comments. <br>\nComment ID can be used in any other feature&#39;s comment section to delete/modify comments. </p>\n\n<p>Suppose A staff member was given access to orders and products. Now he commented on the orders and after some days his access to orders was limited by owner.
