    "vulnerability_information": "Hi Grab Security Team, \n\nFirst of all, best wishes for 2018, empty of bugs if possible ;-) \n\n**Summary:** I found that the following endpoint is hosting Netflix Eureka Server \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and that even if some URLs are requiring authentication (401 code for some of thems like /metrics for example), it is still possible to send requests to the REST API. \n\n**Description:** I think that this is a test infrastructure, however the dashboard some applications registered on Netflix Eureka server (please see screenshot attached \"\u2588\u2588\u2588\") which targets private EC2 instance (nothing published on the Internet) are visible. \n\nDigging a little bit shows that Netflix provides a REST API described here :\n\n```\nhttps://github.com/Netflix/eureka/wiki/Eureka-REST-operations\n```\nI tried some requests and it seems that it does not require any kind of authentication. I prefer to do some tests that could not lead to any disruption (even if this seems to be a test infrastructure), but for example the following request returns 200 :\n\n```\nPUT \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588HTTP/1.1\nHost: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588myteksi.net\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.9 Safari/537.36\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: fr,fr-FR;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.5,en;q=0.3\nConnection: close\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\n```\nAnd the response is the following \n\n```\nHTTP/1.1 200 \nDate: Fri, 12 Jan 2018 09:17:36 GMT\nContent-Type: application/xml\nContent-Length: 0\nConnection: close\nServer: Tengine/2.2.1\n```\n\nFollowing the description of the REST API, I think that an attacker could modify any propertie regarding the current instances registered or even register a new one with his own settings. As I am not sure if there is some production behind, I choose to report it directly without doing any modification on the current systems. \n\n## Browsers Verified In:\n\nN/A\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. Go to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for the dashboard access (read only)\n  1. Issue for example the above HTTP requestand check the server response (or any of the requests described in Netflix documentation)\n\n## Supporting Material/References:\n\n  * List any additional material (e.g. screenshots, video, logs, etc.)\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts,\n\nKind regards,\n\nReptou\n\n## Impact\n\nFrom my perspective, this could help an attacker registers his custom AWS EC2 instance into an application and make it part of the service load balancing provided by Eureka.",

    "vulnerability_information_html": "<p>Hi Grab Security Team, </p>\n\n<p>First of all, best wishes for 2018, empty of bugs if possible ;-) </p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> I found that the following endpoint is hosting Netflix Eureka Server \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and that even if some URLs are requiring authentication (401 code for some of thems like /metrics for example), it is still possible to send requests to the REST API. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> I think that this is a test infrastructure, however the dashboard some applications registered on Netflix Eureka server (please see screenshot attached &quot;\u2588\u2588\u2588&quot;) which targets private EC2 instance (nothing published on the Internet) are visible. </p>\n\n<p>Digging a little bit shows that Netflix provides a REST API described here :</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/wiki/Eureka-REST-operations\n</code></pre>\n<p>I tried some requests and it seems that it does not require any kind of authentication. I prefer to do some tests that could not lead to any disruption (even if this seems to be a test infrastructure), but for example the following request returns 200 :</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>PUT \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588HTTP/1.1\nHost: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588myteksi.net\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.9 Safari/537.36\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: fr,fr-FR;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.5,en;q=0.3\nConnection: close\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the response is the following </p>\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>HTTP/1.1 200 \nDate: Fri, 12 Jan 2018 09:17:36 GMT\nContent-Type: application/xml\nContent-Length: 0\nConnection: close\nServer: Tengine/2.2.1\n</code></pre>\n<p>Following the description of the REST API, I think that an attacker could modify any propertie regarding the current instances registered or even register a new one with his own settings. As I am not sure if there is some production behind, I choose to report it directly without doing any modification on the current systems. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"browsers-verified-in\">Browsers Verified In:</h2>\n\n<p>N/A</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"steps-to-reproduce\">Steps To Reproduce:</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Go to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 for the dashboard access (read only)</li>\n<li>Issue for example the above HTTP requestand check the server response (or any of the requests described in Netflix documentation)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"supporting-material-references\">Supporting Material/References:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>List any additional material (e.g. screenshots, video, logs, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please let me know your thoughts,</p>\n\n<p>Kind regards,</p>\n\n<p>Reptou</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"impact\">Impact</h2>\n\n<p>From my perspective, this could help an attacker registers his custom AWS EC2 instance into an application and make it part of the service load balancing provided by Eureka.</p>\n",
