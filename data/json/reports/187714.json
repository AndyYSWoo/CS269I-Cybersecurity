This is not an account takeover because while we do override the password associated with that specific mail we just login to a \"new\" account and not the user's original one.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n===\n1) Create first account via Vine for android with the mail firstaccountmail@gmail.com with the password Bla123\n2) You can now see that you can login to the account created above.\n3) Go and create another account - this time with a different password and with the mail Firstaccountmail@gmail.com - notice the CAPS (you can put the caps everywhere on the mail).\n4) Finish the creation process - and see that it succeeds\n5) Now go back and try to login with firstaccountmail@gmail.com and the password Bla123 and see that you can't. However, it's possible to login with firstaccountmail@gmail.com and the second password you have created - but you\"ll login to the second created account.",
