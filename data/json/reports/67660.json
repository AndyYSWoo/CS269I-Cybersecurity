Notice that you are able to Disable Two-Step by using past verification code \r\n\r\nThis is a weird behavior of the MagicCode. Its not time based as well. I have tried it after waiting sufficient time. There are other codes as well received during the test like the code for disabling 2-FA but they behave differently.\r\n\r\nCurrently I am trying to build attack scenario where an attacker can take advantage of this behavior but nevertheless it does not stop you from delving into the matter and fixing the issue. \r\n ",
