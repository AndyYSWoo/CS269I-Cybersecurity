    "vulnerability_information": "A readme (or read me) file contains information about other files in a directory or archive and is commonly distributed with computersoftware. Such a file is usually a text file called README.TXT, README.md, README.1ST, READ.ME, or simply README, although someMicrosoft Windows software may occasionally include a README.WRI, README.RTF, or README.DOC. The name is chosen so that users unaware of the existence of this type of file would be drawn to read it. It is traditionally written in upper case so that on case-preserving environments using an ASCIIbetical ordering, the name will appear near the beginning of a directory listing (since upper-case letters sort before lower-case letters in ASCIIbetical ordering)..\r\n\r\nfor more see \r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README\r\n\r\n\r\ncontent of README.md\r\n\r\n# Localize\r\n\r\nWe believe that everybody should be able to use software in their own language.\r\n\r\nLocalize takes care of all the background work.
