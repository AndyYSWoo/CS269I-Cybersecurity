An attacker can embed the config URI \"https://mobilesdk.cloudflare.com/api/v1/config\" as a hidden iframe on their site, and then access/store the victim's JSON output containing the details.\n\nReproduce:\n1. Create an account at https://mobilesdk.cloudflare.com\n2. Login\n3. Visit https://yoxall.me.uk/b/cf-testAUTH.html (here you'll see 2 embedded iframe's containing your details and API keys.)\n\nImage: https://i.imgur.com/vR7sq8Y.png\n\n## Impact\n\nThe vulnerability could leak a lot of private details, including but not limited to app private API keys, auth keys, e-mail addresses, names, phone number, location, etc.\n\nGiven the client key is \"hidden\" at start and used to initiate the app signup process, it's possible the attacker may be able to impersonate the user and take control of their app in some way? Although can't verify this, as I don't have the SDK downloaded.",
