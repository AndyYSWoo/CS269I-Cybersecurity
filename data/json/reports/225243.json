Now that you have brought that to our attention, I imagine this will be awarded the same amount as #195224 since it has similar properties.\n\nThe reason this original got awarded less than #195224 is because our assumption that a UUID was required, which is obviously harder to guess than brute forcing 6 digits of a phone number.\n\n\n\n",
