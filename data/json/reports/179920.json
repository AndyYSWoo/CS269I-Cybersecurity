This means that during regular (expected) usage, the query would be broken and a developer would fix it. If a developer is putting something directly into the query part of a `wpdb::prepare` call, they could also just do `$wpdb->prepare( \"grr' ...\", ... )`. What we were attempting to protect against in 4.8.3 with regard to this, was developers that were using common practices that they *expected* (likely reasonably so) to be secure but they weren't. This included user-controlled data going into the query part of a `wpdb::prepare()` call only **after** having gone through `esc_sql()` or another `wpdb::prepare()` which the developer thought was protecting them.\n\nI also scanned the WordPress.org plugin directory and am not seeing any matches for `%[1-9][0-9]*\\$%s`. Can you point to the plugins you are saying are vulnerable? (Ref: https://twitter.com/mslavco/status/925686658779009025)\n\n## Memory\n\nI had a couple people on our team compare memory usage of 4.8.2 and 4.8.3. We're seeing results like this:\n\n| 4.8.2    | 4.8.3    | Diff     |\n|----------|----------|----------|\n| 14495632 | 14511272 | 15640    |\n| 20143104 | 20156416 | 13312    |\n\nThere is an increase, but it's fairly negligible. Only about 10-20k on an average page load, which doesn't seem like it justifies an adjustment to the memory limit. Hosts don't seem to be noticing any issues related to this either, at least not the ones that I've spoken to so far. Can you tell me what kind of setup you're testing on and what numbers you're seeing?\n\n## Something Else\n\nI'm not sure I'm tracking with the new things you mentioned:\n\n> `code where variable is esc_sql-ed`\n...\n`code where wp-load.php is included/required again`\n...\n`salute extra data in the variable that won't be removed by ->query`\n\nCould you expand on these or supply a PoC to help us understand what you mean?\n\nThanks,\nAaron",
