It will cause reputation loss.\n\nPROOF OF CONCEPT:\n\nFOR PROOF OF CONCEPT YOU CAN SEE IN SCREEN SHOT WHICH I AM ATTACHING THAT BY YOUR COMPANY MAIL I AM ABLE TO SEND ANYONE EMAIL WHATEVER I WANT. I TESTED IT ON MY OWN ACCOUNT. PLEASE SEE THE SCREEN SHOT.\n\nTHANKS \nBEST REGARDS: \nHUSNAIN IQBAL",
