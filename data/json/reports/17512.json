This may take several days.\n\nBrute forcing a password reset token will take years, not several days. Looking at the time window a password reset token is valid, this is (again) not realistic. If you like, check out [this code](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/blob/d56641f514f54da04f778b2a9b816561df7910c2/lib/devise/token_generator.rb). That's the class we use for generating password reset and confirmation tokens.\n\n> But why aren't any measures against Brute Force are implemented on hackerone?\n\nBecause none of the attacks are realistic. In theory they would work, but so far we have never seen a realistic attack scenario regarding tokens we use (password reset, confirmations, invitations).\n\n> What about creating a fake account and guessing the confirmation token? \n\nThe only theoretical impact is that you can confirm a user account that has an email address you don't actually own. I don't see any other implications and doubt that it's an actual security bug. Am I missing something?\n\n> How can you say I requested a password Reset link for your account?\n\nPlease read my comment again, because I didn't say that. I never had someone else request a password reset for my account. Since you mentioned it in your initial submission, it's possible you triggered it (even by accident). Just making sure we're at the same page about the rules of our bug bounty program.",

Our users know that we're a security oriented site, and although we really don't like to bother our users with stuff like this, I think that they will have enough understanding of the situation to not leave our site.

Your original report was called \"Account takeover\", but it turned into \"Ability to spam members of HackerOne\", which is a totally different report in my opinion. You maybe could've even replied on the already closed \"User Enumeration\" report.\n\nWe handle all reports with care, so there is no need to worry that we won't reply to you if you create another report for another bug!\n\nThanks again for the explanation, and thanks for the effort you put in helping us improve our security!\n\nRemon",
