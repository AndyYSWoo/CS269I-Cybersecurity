You suggested using the data to contact white-hat hackers to try to convince them to sell you vulnerabilities (turning them to grey- or blackhats, low feasibility) that were already known to the vendor (no 0-days, medium impact). \n\nAn approach that you could take with the same feasibility, and a higher impact, is just cold-calling the hackers and asking them to sell you vulnerabilities. You would run the same kinds of risks, and you'd get actual 0-days instead of having to race the team. \n\nThe reason we awarded a bounty is that we appreciate you calling our attention to the exposure of the data. However, we do not feel that the issue does not warrant a heightened bounty amount.\n\nI hope this answers your question,\nKind regards,\nDirk",
