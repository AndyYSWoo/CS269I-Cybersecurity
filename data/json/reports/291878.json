    "vulnerability_information": "Vulnerable place 1: `wp-admin/post.php`\n`$newmeta['thumb']` is placed into DB not sanitized directly from user input.\n```\ncase 'editattachment':\n    check_admin_referer('update-post_' . $post_id);\n    // Don't let these be changed\n    unset($_POST['guid']);\n    $_POST['post_type'] = 'attachment';\n    // Update the thumbnail filename\n    $newmeta = wp_get_attachment_metadata( $post_id, true );\n    $newmeta['thumb'] = $_POST['thumb'];\n    wp_update_attachment_metadata( $post_id, $newmeta );\n``` \nVulnerable place 2: `wp_delete_attachment` \nThere we have `$meta = wp_get_attachment_metadata( $post_id );` and below in the code:\n```\nif ( ! empty($meta['thumb']) ) {\n        // Don't delete the thumb if another attachment uses it.\n        if (! $wpdb->get_row( $wpdb->prepare( \"SELECT meta_id FROM $wpdb->postmeta WHERE meta_key = '_wp_attachment_metadata' AND meta_value LIKE %s AND post_id <> %d\", '%' . $wpdb->esc_like( $meta['thumb'] ) . '%', $post_id)) ) {\n            $thumbfile = str_replace(basename($file), $meta['thumb'], $file);\n            /** This filter is documented in wp-includes/functions.php */\n            $thumbfile = apply_filters( 'wp_delete_file', $thumbfile );\n            @ unlink( path_join($uploadpath['basedir'], $thumbfile) );\n        }\n    }\n```\nThis means we can craft any value from the `wp-admin` for `thumb` property and that value to be sent towards `@unlink`\n\nHow to reproduce:\n\n1. Upload image via media menu e.g. new\n2. Go to edit post (old fashioned way)\n3. Grad the `id`, `_wpnonce` and choose your payload `../../../../wp-config.php`\n4. Craft your payload(set auth cookies, ua, referrers, ...): \n```\ncurl 'http://localhost/ripsa/wpvuln/wp-admin/post.php?post=[your_postid]&action=editattachment&_wpnonce=[yournonce]' -H 'place your client headers: ua, cookies in order to mimic the authenticated user ' -d 'thumb=../../../../wp-config-slavco.php' --compressed \n```\n5. Delete the file from the admin\n\nImpact:\n1. Requires user that have permission to manipulate media files / posts\n2. Hard to be spotted because:\n2.1 Payload is deleted from DB\n2.2 `@unlink` won't rise error in case of any failed attempts\n3. Affects many blogging/publishing, e-commerce, ...  setups.\n\nAttack:\n1. Delete `wp-config.php` and relaunch wp setup with remote attackers db - RCE \n2. Delete `.htaccess` or any another `index.html`/`index.php` in order to disclose any stored data under web accessible directory\n",

If we _are_ going to introduce a safety measure to prevent critical file deletion (and my personal opinion is that we should) that fix should be handled globally, in such a way that plugins and themes opting into using `wp_delete_file()` would be protected, and outside of this fix specifically.\n\nPlugins or themes calling `unlink()` directly will always be free to behave badly, and WordPress should provide the best tooling within itself as an application to prevent accidents, while trusting the rest of the server to be configured in such a way that important application files (like WordPress core files) cannot be blindly unlinked.\n\n----\n\nMy attached patch is a backwards compatibility break. Plugins attempting to pass a relative file path to this very-old `'thumb'` parameter (normally only accessed via a pre-3.0 admin screen) will now fail, but I believe that break is worth it here, given both the age of that code and how unlikely it is to be relied upon in the wild.\n\nWe try to get consensus from the team when backwards compatibility breaks are necessary. It's also possible my suggested fix is not the best approach, but this is my progress from tonight so I wanted to update everyone.\n\n----\n\nIt's hard to put into words how frustrating and embarrassing it is for issues to go stale like this one did, from both sides of the issue fwiw. I'm sorry this went ignored. I know my apology means very little, but it needs to be said and I do feel all of these things.\n\nWhen there is progress, one of us will update here.\n\nThanks,\n-JJJ",
