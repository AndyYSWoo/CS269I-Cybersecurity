    "vulnerability_information": "Hi there,\n\nI noticed when we hit the /users_sign_in endpoint too many times it will give us \n\n`````\nHTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests\nDate: Mon, 19 Sep 2016 01:52:19 GMT\nContent-Type: text/plain\n`````\n\nHowever, this can be \"reset\" although I struggle to get it to work EVERYTIME on /users/sign_in. This however, does work all the time on /users/password endpoint hence why i'm reporting so maybe you can investigate further on the /users_sign_in endpoint.\n\nIf we send the following POST:\n\n`````\nPOST /users/password HTTP/1.1\nHost: hackerone.com\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 206\nCache-Control: max-age=0\nOrigin: https://hackerone.com\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/52.0.2743.116 Safari/537.36\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8\nDNT: 1\nReferer: https://hackerone.com/users/password/new\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nAccept-Language: en-GB,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.6\nCookie: cookies_here\n\nauthenticity_token=your_token_here&utf8=%E2%9C%93&user%5Bemail%5D=email@here.com&commit=Send\n`````\n\nNow send the request around ~10 times and it'll hit \"Too Many Requests\". Now simply add %00 on the end of the email and resend even more password reset emails. \n\n&user%5Bemail%5D=email@here.com%00 - and keep adding %00 everytime you are rate limited. After a while you can go back to just %00 as it resets after so long.\n\nI tried this on the /users/sign_in endpoint like I said and was successful for about ~50 login attempts before it just died and kept giving me a Precondition error each time (I wonder if I need to change auth_token every few requests?). I'm going to keep investigating in the morning.\n\nNo real impact with just mass emailing someone a reset password link, but I thought it was worth reporting because the rate limiting bypass might exist in other areas (with the use of the null byte %00)\n\n{F121260}",

This however, does work all the time on /users/password endpoint hence why i&#39;m reporting so maybe you can investigate further on the /users_sign_in endpoint.</p>\n\n<p>If we send the following POST:</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>POST /users/password HTTP/1.1\nHost: hackerone.com\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 206\nCache-Control: max-age=0\nOrigin: https://hackerone.com\nUpgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/52.0.2743.116 Safari/537.36\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8\nDNT: 1\nReferer: https://hackerone.com/users/password/new\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nAccept-Language: en-GB,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.6\nCookie: cookies_here\n\nauthenticity_token=your_token_here&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;user%5Bemail%5D=email@here.com&amp;commit=Send\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now send the request around ~10 times and it&#39;ll hit &quot;Too Many Requests&quot;.

After a while you can go back to just %00 as it resets after so long.</p>\n\n<p>I tried this on the /users/sign_in endpoint like I said and was successful for about ~50 login attempts before it just died and kept giving me a Precondition error each time (I wonder if I need to change auth_token every few requests?). I&#39;m going to keep investigating in the morning.</p>\n\n<p>No real impact with just mass emailing someone a reset password link, but I thought it was worth reporting because the rate limiting bypass might exist in other areas (with the use of the null byte %00)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"#\" class=\"markdown-attachment-link markdown-attachment-inline-reference\" data-attachment-filename=\"ss_(2016-09-19_at_03.02.28).png\" data-attachment-link=\"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/121/260/29b27f3834cdb0c4fd15b4d7b34691856089fb89/ss_%282016-09-19_at_03.02.28%29.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQ5B43OTPE%2F20181206%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20181206T224610Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-Security-Token=FQoGZXIvYXdzEA8aDCiDARkX3ArKGaO7%2ByK3A39tqjzyooRkX4qPdNM7MkAemep3r5%2Fh%2B11ZdH6KbZ8q2cgU%2FRMODKRq75fJ6sn%2FkR1fBrPaMFfKsP%2BSLpkSrkbyi968FqbmO6yo59Heb3d1kDMwzaNShj3ou%2Fq9qAc5NWgXlxJtABJqkgxPd5NovxMOsASin8kfBjU8OhOOEnonvd2t16oF509MVoA81P%2Frmr4njIb3UfHzYyccuDQNjHM0qV7B57bCKQeIuO%2FzLl7au%2FWR2v6R6bwK6fGUYVbcnAam9GqobWJnMl6NFbipNSdmUzB5%2BglRYaYeGXxbgxseM7SSFeehfzbywUoHEf4Ve61V1e90uyx3M0Krbm5QjS5gNgwErj0g2rC2mkrl2q%2B9ADfOzgMAX8fUODFalEv4gZf0ZKuLhpmAzEapJE5f%2BarcSkdn5b0ddy4Wa2vdsZ6lQ5NOez8qkcnaBEJZLnv3YGHyInLrIaUkqlq4iavZpr4f5Al5PueqIzLuItn5ztJjfvCu5dDIplWP0eo6r%2BIUCKsDwUNkRSgWCtJbCfl%2BPF3PKHjvnmVEBawLZlpXvaOGUvA%2FKYb2cGGXn89CPjYlwpWCj2J8Z%2B0okbim4AU%3D&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=929458ff11540ef6910278fc99c95a627408dd6872692ae79ffdfb3e45a3f8a9\" data-attachment-type=\"image/png\"><img src=\"https://hackerone-us-west-2-production-attachments.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/000/121/260/29b27f3834cdb0c4fd15b4d7b34691856089fb89/ss_%282016-09-19_at_03.02.28%29.png?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQGK6FURQ5B43OTPE%2F20181206%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20181206T224610Z&amp;X-Amz-Expires=3600&amp;X-Amz-Security-Token=FQoGZXIvYXdzEA8aDCiDARkX3ArKGaO7%2ByK3A39tqjzyooRkX4qPdNM7MkAemep3r5%2Fh%2B11ZdH6KbZ8q2cgU%2FRMODKRq75fJ6sn%2FkR1fBrPaMFfKsP%2BSLpkSrkbyi968FqbmO6yo59Heb3d1kDMwzaNShj3ou%2Fq9qAc5NWgXlxJtABJqkgxPd5NovxMOsASin8kfBjU8OhOOEnonvd2t16oF509MVoA81P%2Frmr4njIb3UfHzYyccuDQNjHM0qV7B57bCKQeIuO%2FzLl7au%2FWR2v6R6bwK6fGUYVbcnAam9GqobWJnMl6NFbipNSdmUzB5%2BglRYaYeGXxbgxseM7SSFeehfzbywUoHEf4Ve61V1e90uyx3M0Krbm5QjS5gNgwErj0g2rC2mkrl2q%2B9ADfOzgMAX8fUODFalEv4gZf0ZKuLhpmAzEapJE5f%2BarcSkdn5b0ddy4Wa2vdsZ6lQ5NOez8qkcnaBEJZLnv3YGHyInLrIaUkqlq4iavZpr4f5Al5PueqIzLuItn5ztJjfvCu5dDIplWP0eo6r%2BIUCKsDwUNkRSgWCtJbCfl%2BPF3PKHjvnmVEBawLZlpXvaOGUvA%2FKYb2cGGXn89CPjYlwpWCj2J8Z%2B0okbim4AU%3D&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Signature=929458ff11540ef6910278fc99c95a627408dd6872692ae79ffdfb3e45a3f8a9\" class=\"markdown-inline-image\"></a></p>\n",
