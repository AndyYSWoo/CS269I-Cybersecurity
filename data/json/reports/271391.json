PHPUnit is indeed installed: `https://www.zomato.com/vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php`. However, it appears that you are fortunately running the patched version. Reference: `http://phpunit.vulnbusters.com/`.\n\n\n## Additional notes\n\nI did try other directories, like the `logs/` directory, but it doesn't seem to be exposed.
