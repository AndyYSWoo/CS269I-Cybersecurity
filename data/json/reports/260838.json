    "vulnerability_information": "hi there , \n\nWhile looking around into your web application I noticed in the fields Firstname and Lastname you can set a url . example ` ( http://www.evilsite.com) ` .  where I am using special characters like `://` and `.` . but when I try out other special characters - or particularly a payload such as `\"><svg/onload=prompt(1)>` , it will not be allowed in the first name and last name fields . which means as a protection mechanism this is getting filtered out along with the additional special characters . again using null valus like `%00%` , is allowed in the fields and updates First name or last name , so it means when you are trying to update your name with such values your name is getting reverted back to the old one .\n\nThe intended behavior is not applied for all cases , that is why first name and last name can be updated with multiple special characters and null values . I think usage of special characters should be controlled and checked again by you guys . as you are filtering out payloads which potentially contain multiple special characters but you are allowing usage of special characters in under few circumstances . \n\nI am also attaching a video . Hope you will check and get back with a response soon . \n\nThanks . \n\n",

I think usage of special characters should be controlled and checked again by you guys . as you are filtering out payloads which potentially contain multiple special characters but you are allowing usage of special characters in under few circumstances . </p>\n\n<p>I am also attaching a video . Hope you will check and get back with a response soon . </p>\n\n<p>Thanks . </p>\n",
