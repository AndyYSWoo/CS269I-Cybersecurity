Here's a demo that completely redirects a learner from KA to another site: https://www.khanacademy.org/physics/woah/4740384569491456.  \n\n**Note**: the stored script does not run in Firefox because document projects don't seem to be working on that browser (at least on my machine).",

Since KA document projects output HTML, I can edit the PUT request that updates projects (<a title=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/api/internal/scratchpads/ID\" href=\"/redirect?signature=85fa58b3ecad6485b41e32546e45e75d69a79085&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.khanacademy.org%2Fapi%2Finternal%2Fscratchpads%2FID\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://www.khanacademy.org/api/internal/scratchpads/ID</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a>) and inject JavaScript code inside an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag&#39;s <code>onload</code> attribute.  Here&#39;s a demo that completely redirects a learner from KA to another site: <a title=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/physics/woah/4740384569491456\" href=\"/redirect?signature=30a8b440ad01a05f041a496c4efc5fe0c7e078fe&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.khanacademy.org%2Fphysics%2Fwoah%2F4740384569491456\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://www.khanacademy.org/physics/woah/4740384569491456</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a>.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: the stored script does not run in Firefox because document projects don&#39;t seem to be working on that browser (at least on my machine).</p>\n",
