SendGrid support pointed me to their Security FAQ, which had nothing to do with my questions. Mandrill has yet to respond at all.\n\nBasically, we use SendGrid for sending out most of our e-mail, but we also utilize a third-party service for some backoffice stuff, which sends e-mails (using @hackerone.com addresses) using Mandrill. As such, we added Mandrill to our SPF record and added their DKIM public key as well. However, you make a good point about that enabling any Mandrill customer to send e-mail as us (and possibly also any SendGrid customer using our current configuration).\n\nIn the mean time, I've reached out to the folks internally who use the third-party service to see if we can disable it for now (so I can remove Mandrill).\n\nWill follow-up once I have more information.
