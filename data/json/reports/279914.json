This is the fixed that reported in #38343. \n\nHowever, it defeats the fix in #38343 because when a password changed in `password reset links` for `disabled/inactive user` does not receive notification via email containing that password was recently changed.\n\n__POC__ \nhttps://vimeo.com/214135835\npassword: protection",
