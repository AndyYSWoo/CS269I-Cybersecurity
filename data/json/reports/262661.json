I used @jong_jong accounts to submit test report to Parrot Sec program.\n  2. @phspade closed my test report then i ask him to review me and give him some instruction to perfrom an IDOR.\n  3. @phspade click the review button and put the below necessary info: Selected `Friendliness` radio button, __Public feedback:__ `Japz is awesome :)`, __Private feedback:__ `Thanks for your report.`\n  4. Submit the report and capture the request, on __POST /hacker_reviews HTTP/1.1__ you will see this parameters with it's values `hacker_username=jong_jong&report_id=<redacted>&positive=true&behavior=friendly&private_feedback=Thanks+for+your+report.`\n  5. The vulnerable param is the __hacker_username__ , change the  value to victims username. (e.g `hacker_username=japzdivino`) and forward the request.\n  \n__japzdivino__ will received an email notification regarding the review, but it should be jong_jong should be the one to received\n\n{F215257}\n\nAlso japz profile will display the public review, instead of jong_jong's profile.\n\n{F215258}\n\nLet me know if anything else is needed.\n\nRegards\nJapz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It first looks up if there's already a review for that particular report. If not, it'll see if you're authorized to write a review for that report. Then, it'll do a separate query to see if you can write a review for the user. This isn't tied to the report, so you are able to write a review for someone that didn't submit the report. However, the user still needs to have submitted a report to ANY of the programs you manage (verified programs). Even though it's an odd way of checking whether you can review the user, I wouldn't say it's a vulnerability. The title is disclosed in the email, but if a team member wants to send the report title to someone, they can already do that. It sounds like this turns out not to be a security vulnerability. Perhaps I'm missing something, so please let me know what you think. Thanks!",

This isn&#39;t tied to the report, so you are able to write a review for someone that didn&#39;t submit the report. However, the user still needs to have submitted a report to ANY of the programs you manage (verified programs). Even though it&#39;s an odd way of checking whether you can review the user, I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a vulnerability. The title is disclosed in the email, but if a team member wants to send the report title to someone, they can already do that. It sounds like this turns out not to be a security vulnerability. Perhaps I&#39;m missing something, so please let me know what you think. Thanks!</p>\n",
