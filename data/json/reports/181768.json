This attack, called POODLE, is similar to the BEAST attack and also allows a network attacker to extract the plaintext of targeted parts of an SSL connection, usually cookie data. Unlike the BEAST attack, it doesn't require such extensive control of the format of the plaintext and thus is more practical. \nAny website that supports SSLv3 is vulnerable to POODLE, even if it also supports more recent versions of TLS. SSLv3 is disabled by default in Firefox 34, which was released on Nov 25 2014.\nAn attacker may be able to exploit this problem to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks and decrypt communications between the affected service and clients",

This attack, called POODLE, is similar to the BEAST attack and also allows a network attacker to extract the plaintext of targeted parts of an SSL connection, usually cookie data. Unlike the BEAST attack, it doesn&#39;t require such extensive control of the format of the plaintext and thus is more practical. <br>\nAny website that supports SSLv3 is vulnerable to POODLE, even if it also supports more recent versions of TLS. SSLv3 is disabled by default in Firefox 34, which was released on Nov 25 2014.<br>\nAn attacker may be able to exploit this problem to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks and decrypt communications between the affected service and clients</p>\n",
