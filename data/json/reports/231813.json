I entered the email address of (the guy whose email address was getting displayed in the bug: https://hackerone.com/reports/231749, I had seen the same email address today morning, but didnt click on my mind to report).\n\nEarlier when I tried my gmail address, I was given the error that the I am not authorized to access the dashboard. Now with the email ****@cuvva.com, I was able to move to the next step. Now the verification code was sent to the email address, and option came to enter the 6 character code.\n\nThe attacker can brute force the 6 character code very easily. There is no restriction on the times the code is entered.\n\n1. You need to change the email address used to access the dashboard - the current email is easily accessible.\n2. Put restriction on the number of times the verified code can be entered.",

I entered the email address of (the guy whose email address was getting displayed in the bug: <a title=\"https://hackerone.com/reports/231749\" href=\"https://hackerone.com/reports/231749\">https://hackerone.com/reports/231749</a>, I had seen the same email address today morning, but didnt click on my mind to report).</p>\n\n<p>Earlier when I tried my gmail address, I was given the error that the I am not authorized to access the dashboard. Now with the email ****@cuvva.com, I was able to move to the next step. Now the verification code was sent to the email address, and option came to enter the 6 character code.</p>\n\n<p>The attacker can brute force the 6 character code very easily. There is no restriction on the times the code is entered.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>You need to change the email address used to access the dashboard - the current email is easily accessible.</li>\n<li>Put restriction on the number of times the verified code can be entered.</li>\n</ol>\n",
