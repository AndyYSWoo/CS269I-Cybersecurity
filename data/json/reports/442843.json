I can stop reaching out to H1 if they don't reward the ethical researchers who are willing to help their platform more secure.\n\nPlease consider this as a  valid finding and reward it this time .\n\n## Impact\n\nThis could be a serious issue for HackerOne since the program owners will loose trust in the service and might stop using this platform .",

PFA for more info i can access related to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 etc. See the date it&#39;s 16th November .</p>\n\n<p>Quick Note:<br>\nLast time when i reported the issue the H1 team decided not to reward it. <a title=\"https://hackerone.com/reports/438306\" href=\"https://hackerone.com/reports/438306\">https://hackerone.com/reports/438306</a><br>\nHowever this time it&#39;s happening again. I can stop reaching out to H1 if they don&#39;t reward the ethical researchers who are willing to help their platform more secure.</p>\n\n<p>Please consider this as a  valid finding and reward it this time .</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"impact\">Impact</h2>\n\n<p>This could be a serious issue for HackerOne since the program owners will loose trust in the service and might stop using this platform .</p>\n",
