It is a number.\n* Now go to the other account also make a course.\n* Edit this course, and capture the POST of the request that is made to edit the course.\n* Repeat the request but change the \"id\" parameter to the id the course that was made in the other account.\n* reload the page\n* The course got removed from the creator's account and was inserted into the account of the attacker.\n\n#impact\nAttacker can remove all courses of all users by iterating trough all the course id's.\n\n",
