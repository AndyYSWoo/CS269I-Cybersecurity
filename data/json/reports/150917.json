Go to https://gratipay.com/~username/emails/\n2. Enter `yourname@domain.com\\0` or `you@abc.com%00` or `you@xyz.com$`\n3. Now ***Inspect Element*** the field and change field type to **`text`** from **`email`**\n4. Click on **Add email address**.\nYou'll see an error message ***Looks like you've found a bug! Sorry for the inconvenience, we'll get it fixed ASAP!***\nNow reload the page and you'll see the email listed.\n\nIt means server side validation of email is not okay.\nValidation should be improved.\n\nFor your reference, #3227 and #3991 are same kind of bug which were resolved.\n\n----------------\nZawad",
