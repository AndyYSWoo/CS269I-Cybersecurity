This is a big issue as one can download all the attachements of registered users, while the attacker is not actually logged in the application ! Also, I have found another link that leaks attachement names.\n\nBecause of the severity, I have attached a POC video.\n\nVideo description : at first, I will get a public task share link. With that link, I will have access to 2 tasks, only 1 witch has an attachement. By using burp calls, I will leak the names of other attachements. After this, I will try to view my attachement and download it. As you can see in the video, just changing the id form the link, allows me to download other restricted files !",

This is a big issue as one can download all the attachements of registered users, while the attacker is not actually logged in the application ! Also, I have found another link that leaks attachement names.</p>\n\n<p>Because of the severity, I have attached a POC video.</p>\n\n<p>Video description : at first, I will get a public task share link. With that link, I will have access to 2 tasks, only 1 witch has an attachement. By using burp calls, I will leak the names of other attachements. After this, I will try to view my attachement and download it. As you can see in the video, just changing the id form the link, allows me to download other restricted files !</p>\n",
