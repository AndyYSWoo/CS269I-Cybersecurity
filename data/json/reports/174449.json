I got invite to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 private program.\n2. After period of time I quit that program.\n3. I still get email updates about that program.\n\n### soultions\n1. Remove email address from program once hacker quit.\n2. Set boolean flag, true/false once the user quit. (The flag can help once the user gets invite again or if he/she wants to rejoin).\n\nThanks,\nSasi",
