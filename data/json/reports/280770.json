    "vulnerability_information": "**Summary:**\nSearch query text, including from potentially undisclosed reports, sent to Google Analytics on Inbox query page\n\n**Description (Include Impact):**\nSince search query text can both include content of private vulnerabilities, it shouldn't be sent to Google Analytics.  Furthermore, the information sent to GA includes information indicating the presence of a report and its status associated with a particular company (if there is a non-zero report_id and a filtered reported_to_team parameter), which further pins down that a company has a report with certain yet-undisclosed text in said report. Finally, search query text can contain PII, and therefore should not be sent to GA (however, I am not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice).\n\n**Mitigation:**  Client-side redaction of the 'reported_to_team' and 'text_query' params (at the least) before posting to GA.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Visit the permalink URL for an inbox search query (for example, searching for \"SOME_UNDISCLOSED_REPORT_OR_PII_INFO_HERE\" and filtering to HackerOne gives a URL like: \nhttps://hackerone.com/bugs?subject=user&report_id=0&view=custom&substates%5B%5D=pre-submission&substates%5B%5D=new&substates%5B%5D=needs-more-info&substates%5B%5D=triaged&substates%5B%5D=duplicate&substates%5B%5D=informative&substates%5B%5D=resolved&substates%5B%5D=not-applicable&substates%5B%5D=spam&reported_to_team=security&text_query=SOME_UNDISCLOSED_REPORT_OR_PII_INFO_HERE&program_states%5B%5D=2&program_states%5B%5D=3&program_states%5B%5D=4&program_states%5B%5D=5&sort_type=pg_search_rank&sort_direction=descending&limit=25&page=1 )\n\n2. Note in the browser network inspector a www.google-analytics.com/collect post containing the sensitive information in the dl param (I have omitted all numeric identifiers for the sake of future disclosure) :\n`v=1&_v=***&a=***&t=pageview&_s=1&dl=https%3A%2F%2Fhackerone.com%2Fbugs%3Fsubject%3Duser%26report_id%3D0%26view%3Dcustom%26substates%255B%255D%3Dpre-submission%26substates%255B%255D%3Dnew%26substates%255B%255D%3Dneeds-more-info%26substates%255B%255D%3Dtriaged%26substates%255B%255D%3Dduplicate%26substates%255B%255D%3Dinformative%26substates%255B%255D%3Dresolved%26substates%255B%255D%3Dnot-applicable%26substates%255B%255D%3Dspam%26reported_to_team%3Dsecurity%26text_query%3DSOME_UNDISCLOSED_REPORT_OR_PII_INFO_HERE%26program_states%255B%255D%3D2%26program_states%255B%255D%3D3%26program_states%255B%255D%3D4%26program_states%255B%255D%3D5%26sort_type%3Dpg_search_rank%26sort_direction%3Ddescending%26limit%3D25%26page%3D1&ul=en-us&de=UTF-8&dt=HackerOne&sd=24-bit&sr=***&vp=***&je=0&_u=***~&jid=&gjid=&cid=***&uid=***&tid=UA-***-1&_gid=***&z=***`\n\n\n\n### Optional: Your Environment (Browser version, Device, etc)\n\n * Mac OS High Sierra, Chrome 61.0.3163.100\n\n### Optional: Supporting Material/References (Screenshots)\n\n * ",

    "vulnerability_information_html": "<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>\nSearch query text, including from potentially undisclosed reports, sent to Google Analytics on Inbox query page</p>\n\n<p><strong>Description (Include Impact):</strong><br>\nSince search query text can both include content of private vulnerabilities, it shouldn&#39;t be sent to Google Analytics.  Furthermore, the information sent to GA includes information indicating the presence of a report and its status associated with a particular company (if there is a non-zero report_id and a filtered reported_to_team parameter), which further pins down that a company has a report with certain yet-undisclosed text in said report. Finally, search query text can contain PII, and therefore should not be sent to GA (however, I am not a lawyer, and this is not legal advice).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong>  Client-side redaction of the &#39;reported_to_team&#39; and &#39;text_query&#39; params (at the least) before posting to GA.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"steps-to-reproduce\">Steps To Reproduce</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Visit the permalink URL for an inbox search query (for example, searching for &quot;SOME_UNDISCLOSED_REPORT_OR_PII_INFO_HERE&quot; and filtering to HackerOne gives a URL like: <br>\n<a title=\"https://hackerone.com/bugs?subject=user&amp;report_id=0&amp;view=custom&amp;substates%5B%5D=pre-submission&amp;substates%5B%5D=new&amp;substates%5B%5D=needs-more-info&amp;substates%5B%5D=triaged&amp;substates%5B%5D=duplicate&amp;substates%5B%5D=informative&amp;substates%5B%5D=resolved&amp;substates%5B%5D=not-applicable&amp;substates%5B%5D=spam&amp;reported_to_team=security&amp;text_query=SOME_UNDISCLOSED_REPORT_OR_PII_INFO_HERE&amp;program_states%5B%5D=2&amp;program_states%5B%5D=3&amp;program_states%5B%5D=4&amp;program_states%5B%5D=5&amp;sort_type=pg_search_rank&amp;sort_direction=descending&amp;limit=25&amp;page=1\" href=\"https://hackerone.com/bugs?subject=user&amp;report_id=0&amp;view=custom&amp;substates%5B%5D=pre-submission&amp;substates%5B%5D=new&amp;substates%5B%5D=needs-more-info&amp;substates%5B%5D=triaged&amp;substates%5B%5D=duplicate&amp;substates%5B%5D=informative&amp;substates%5B%5D=resolved&amp;substates%5B%5D=not-applicable&amp;substates%5B%5D=spam&amp;reported_to_team=security&amp;text_query=SOME_UNDISCLOSED_REPORT_OR_PII_INFO_HERE&amp;program_states%5B%5D=2&amp;program_states%5B%5D=3&amp;program_states%5B%5D=4&amp;program_states%5B%5D=5&amp;sort_type=pg_search_rank&amp;sort_direction=descending&amp;limit=25&amp;page=1\">https://hackerone.com/bugs?subject=user&amp;report_id=0&amp;view=custom&amp;substates%5B%5D=pre-submission&amp;substates%5B%5D=new&amp;substates%5B%5D=needs-more-info&amp;substates%5B%5D=triaged&amp;substates%5B%5D=duplicate&amp;substates%5B%5D=informative&amp;substates%5B%5D=resolved&amp;substates%5B%5D=not-applicable&amp;substates%5B%5D=spam&amp;reported_to_team=security&amp;text_query=SOME_UNDISCLOSED_REPORT_OR_PII_INFO_HERE&amp;program_states%5B%5D=2&amp;program_states%5B%5D=3&amp;program_states%5B%5D=4&amp;program_states%5B%5D=5&amp;sort_type=pg_search_rank&amp;sort_direction=descending&amp;limit=25&amp;page=1</a> )</p></li>\n<li><p>Note in the browser network inspector a <a href=\"/redirect?signature=246a8d8d6af8209ac7618d067a34f7e902ba2ab2&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google-analytics.com%2Fcollect\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>www.google-analytics.com/collect</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a> post containing the sensitive information in the dl param (I have omitted all numeric identifiers for the sake of future disclosure) :<br>\n<code>v=1&amp;_v=***&amp;a=***&amp;t=pageview&amp;_s=1&amp;dl=https%3A%2F%2Fhackerone.com%2Fbugs%3Fsubject%3Duser%26report_id%3D0%26view%3Dcustom%26substates%255B%255D%3Dpre-submission%26substates%255B%255D%3Dnew%26substates%255B%255D%3Dneeds-more-info%26substates%255B%255D%3Dtriaged%26substates%255B%255D%3Dduplicate%26substates%255B%255D%3Dinformative%26substates%255B%255D%3Dresolved%26substates%255B%255D%3Dnot-applicable%26substates%255B%255D%3Dspam%26reported_to_team%3Dsecurity%26text_query%3DSOME_UNDISCLOSED_REPORT_OR_PII_INFO_HERE%26program_states%255B%255D%3D2%26program_states%255B%255D%3D3%26program_states%255B%255D%3D4%26program_states%255B%255D%3D5%26sort_type%3Dpg_search_rank%26sort_direction%3Ddescending%26limit%3D25%26page%3D1&amp;ul=en-us&amp;de=UTF-8&amp;dt=HackerOne&amp;sd=24-bit&amp;sr=***&amp;vp=***&amp;je=0&amp;_u=***~&amp;jid=&amp;gjid=&amp;cid=***&amp;uid=***&amp;tid=UA-***-1&amp;_gid=***&amp;z=***</code></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"optional-your-environment-browser-version-device-etc\">Optional: Your Environment (Browser version, Device, etc)</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mac OS High Sierra, Chrome 61.0.3163.100</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"optional-supporting-material-references-screenshots\">Optional: Supporting Material/References (Screenshots)</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n</ul>\n",
