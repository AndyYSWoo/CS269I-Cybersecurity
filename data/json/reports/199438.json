From there, you can see that we do not use 64 bit cipher suites. All TLS 1.1 and 1.2 are at least 128 bit, though some of the older, low priority TLS 1.0 suites are 112 bit.\n\nSomething important to consider about the SWEET 32 attack: it's largely a problem for services that transfer a significant amount of data over a single TLS session - like a VPN. Even if we were using 64 bit cyphers (which we're not), an attacker would need to examine between 2^29 and 2^36 encrypted 8-bit blocks - that's a whopping 280 to 785GB of traffic from one user during the same TLS session. We use several levels of rate limiting to mitigate other types of attacks, so it would be *extremely difficult* (never say never!) for a user to generate that much traffic without being challenged for a CAPTCHA. To stay under our rate limits, it would be several weeks (or months) before a user could generate that much traffic, even unintentionally. We also automatically log users out well before they could reach that amount of traffic.\n\nWe really do appreciate the report. However, it looks like this one needs some more work. I'll go ahead and set the status to \"Needs more info\" in case I'm missing something.",

From there, you can see that we do not use 64 bit cipher suites. All TLS 1.1 and 1.2 are at least 128 bit, though some of the older, low priority TLS 1.0 suites are 112 bit.</p>\n\n<p>Something important to consider about the SWEET 32 attack: it&#39;s largely a problem for services that transfer a significant amount of data over a single TLS session - like a VPN. Even if we were using 64 bit cyphers (which we&#39;re not), an attacker would need to examine between 2^29 and 2^36 encrypted 8-bit blocks - that&#39;s a whopping 280 to 785GB of traffic from one user during the same TLS session. We use several levels of rate limiting to mitigate other types of attacks, so it would be <em>extremely difficult</em> (never say never!) for a user to generate that much traffic without being challenged for a CAPTCHA. To stay under our rate limits, it would be several weeks (or months) before a user could generate that much traffic, even unintentionally. We also automatically log users out well before they could reach that amount of traffic.</p>\n\n<p>We really do appreciate the report. However, it looks like this one needs some more work. I&#39;ll go ahead and set the status to &quot;Needs more info&quot; in case I&#39;m missing something.</p>\n",
