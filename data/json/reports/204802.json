    "vulnerability_information": "## Summary\nhttps://github.com/uber/pam-ussh was open-sourced today (kudos!) and is presumably used within Uber's infrastructure. This is a PAM module written a Go that \"will authenticate a user based on them having an ssh certificate in their ssh-agent signed by a specified ssh CA.\" A cursory look at the code and the documentation reveals that the module trusts the SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable to determine the Unix domain socket it will use to talk to ssh-agent:\n\nhttps://github.com/uber/pam-ussh/blob/a50585bb7a0f16cd4e813509ad1393731cbb9a14/pam_ussh.go#L70\n\nThe documentation suggests configuring the module for sudo's PAM stack. Since sudo is normally installed SUID root and invokes its PAM stacks with root privileges, it may happily talk to another user's ssh-agent via that other user's and agent's Unix domain socket, despite of this socket not being accessible to the invoking user directly (since it's protected with Unix file permissions). Being an environment variable, SSH_AUTH_SOCK is under control of the user/attacker invoking sudo. In other words, the code and suggested setup effectively bypass Unix file permissions on ssh-agent sockets.\n\nThis appears to be a design error of pam-ussh.\n\n## Security Impact\nA local user may trick pam-ussh and thus sudo to authenticate itself using another local user's certificate. This other user has to be currently logged in, with ssh-agent active. (The attack script may wait for this condition to be met.) The attacking user doesn't have to possess any certificate at all, nor use ssh-agent themselves. In fact, the attack may likely be mounted even by a compromised system service pseudo-user, provided that sudo is within its reach.\n\n## Reproduction Steps\nNot having access to a setup that Uber actually uses within its infrastructure, I can only be moderately confident that this security issue applies and these steps will work. That said, the reproduction steps may be roughly as follows:\n\n1. Login (over SSH or otherwise) as a non-privileged user to a shell account on a system with pam-ussh deployed for sudo.\n\n2. Check the process list and directories matching /tmp/ssh-* for instances of ssh-agent and their sockets corresponding to other logged in users. If none, then wait until this changes.\n\n3. Infer the target user's ssh-agent socket pathname by listing /tmp/ssh-* and obtaining the PID from the process list. The pathname may be of the form /tmp/ssh-RND/agent.PID, where the \"RND\" and \"PID\" portions are determined from the directory listing and the process list, respectively.\n\n4. Invoke a command like \"SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-RND/agent.PID sudo bash\" with the \"RND\" and \"PID\" substituted with substrings identified above.\n\n## Specifics\n* If applicable, what account were you using to test?\n * N/A\n* If applicable, what domain(s) does this vulnerability affect?\n * Unclear - it's internal infrastructure that might be in use behind a variety of Uber services\n* Does this only affect specific versions or vendors?\n * pam-ussh at least as published on GitHub as of today (Feb 8, 2017)\n\nThis might or might not be within scope of Uber's bug bounty program, and I have not actually reproduced the issue - only having identified its likelihood through the source code and documentation. Yet I figured I'd give this communication channel a try, and report this. I'd appreciate a review of these findings and any feedback you might provide.\n\nA related concern is that Go's runtime might not be suitable for use in SUID/SGID programs yet - e.g., it might also have environment variables it trusts too much, as well as many other issues that libc's have been hardened against over the years (and decades). I have not looked into that yet, but you might want to.",

            "message": "Thanks for sharing the patch, @dnathe4th.\n\nMeanwhile, I've been thinking of how to fix this issue best, and I came to the conclusion that the straightforward approach, as this patch takes, results in races that appear unavoidable within traditional Unix syscall semantics. Traditionally, code trying to access untrusted pathnames yet running with excessive privileges uses pre- and post-checks to make sure the file opened is actually the file that was meant to be opened. This would also work for a FIFO, but it doesn't work for Unix domain sockets. Besides, with that approach other (relatively minor) problems traditionally remain: potential side-effects on open(), or in this case on connect() - e.g. another/unintended service receiving a connection attempt, and these attempts/checks serving as an oracle to probe for existence of filesystem entries (not necessarily sockets, and anywhere among mounted filesystems) in directories that the invoking user couldn't have accessed directly.\n\nIn other words, when fixing the main issue (the one with authentication) we should also have in mind that this is privileged code that might have side-effects and/or infoleaks unrelated to its purpose, and the straightforward approach in fact keeps the code problematic in those ways - as well as, and more importantly, in not fully fixing the original issue because of the races, which probably allow for the wrong socket to be accessed again, through the attacker replacing their dummy socket or its holding directory with a (sym)link to the victim's directory/socket.

            "markdown_message": "<p>Thanks for sharing the patch, <a href=\"/dnathe4th\">@dnathe4th</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, I&#39;ve been thinking of how to fix this issue best, and I came to the conclusion that the straightforward approach, as this patch takes, results in races that appear unavoidable within traditional Unix syscall semantics. Traditionally, code trying to access untrusted pathnames yet running with excessive privileges uses pre- and post-checks to make sure the file opened is actually the file that was meant to be opened. This would also work for a FIFO, but it doesn&#39;t work for Unix domain sockets. Besides, with that approach other (relatively minor) problems traditionally remain: potential side-effects on open(), or in this case on connect() - e.g. another/unintended service receiving a connection attempt, and these attempts/checks serving as an oracle to probe for existence of filesystem entries (not necessarily sockets, and anywhere among mounted filesystems) in directories that the invoking user couldn&#39;t have accessed directly.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, when fixing the main issue (the one with authentication) we should also have in mind that this is privileged code that might have side-effects and/or infoleaks unrelated to its purpose, and the straightforward approach in fact keeps the code problematic in those ways - as well as, and more importantly, in not fully fixing the original issue because of the races, which probably allow for the wrong socket to be accessed again, through the attacker replacing their dummy socket or its holding directory with a (sym)link to the victim&#39;s directory/socket. Even if the code post-checked the pathname again, that would be no guarantee the attacker had not replaced the directory/socket back. The attacker can probably manage to obtain the same st_ino, too.

It appears that now Linux-PAM&#39;s pam_unix does use getpwnam_r() and friends, yet it still switches the process global uids:</p>\n\n<p><a title=\"https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/linux-pam.git/tree/modules/pam_unix/passverify.c#n154\" href=\"/redirect?signature=523d77ae6fcf39ae593941aaf7948d1072d06507&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgit.fedorahosted.org%2Fcgit%2Flinux-pam.git%2Ftree%2Fmodules%2Fpam_unix%2Fpassverify.c%23n154\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/linux-pam.git/tree/modules/pam_unix/passverify.c#n154</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a><br>\n<a title=\"https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/linux-pam.git/tree/libpam/pam_modutil_getpwnam.c\" href=\"/redirect?signature=c3b639864bee0f6f480902f534bd2f767814a3a8&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgit.fedorahosted.org%2Fcgit%2Flinux-pam.git%2Ftree%2Flibpam%2Fpam_modutil_getpwnam.c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/linux-pam.git/tree/libpam/pam_modutil_getpwnam.c</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a></p>\n\n<p>This combination appears to be similar to what pam-ussh does now. So this detail on PAM is JFYI, no action needed on it.</p>\n\n<p>In your code, if you wanted to be thread-safer than pam_unix, you could probably switch fsuid instead of euid, which should do the trick in this case due to parent directory permissions - and in fact the uncertainty regarding whether/how permissions on Unix sockets themselves are applied (across different Unix-likes) is probably the reason why OpenSSH does this mkdtemp() in the first place. Note that there&#39;s no getfsuid() - instead, setfsuid()&#39;s return value is the previous fsuid. fsuid should per-thread even with glibc (not only direct syscall). Again, this is just an option, and no change is necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks again for the prompt fix.</p>\n",

(I was already wondering if I should possibly move further discussion to GitHub or e-mail.)\n\nThank you for your prompt handling of this issue and its related sub-issues!\n\nI think you're missing my point regarding the fileUID check. I'll try to explain:\n\nThe problem with doing this check prior to the euid switch isn't limited to accessing another user's ssh-agent socket. It is about probing for existence of any pathname anywhere on the mounted filesystems, not limited to /tmp, nor to sockets. Side-channels allowing for such probing may include timing, log file size growth, log file contents (if readable), and probably/eventually more (e.g., some procfs or sysfs file showing stats on the user's own sudo's use of system resources - protection of such files for user's own invocations of SUID/SGID programs is traditionally inconsistent).\n\nFixing this doesn't strictly require omitting the \"(sock owner: 4015/alice)\" detail from the log message. However, I think I see what you mean: since the other user socket's parent directory is not readable after you've switched the euid, you wouldn't be able to check permissions directly on the socket itself. If you like, you could then fall back to recording permissions of the directory, just for the log message (and have it say those are for the directory). I am not sure if this complexity is justified.\n\nOne more issue I haven't yet mentioned: much of our logic so far is specific to sudo's use of the module. In case the module is stacked for su, the logic falls apart. The target user would be root, so that's the username you'd obtain from PAM and you would be accessing the socket with root privileges. However, the env var remains under control of an unprivileged user (and moreover even if it is not altered then it's set to point to the user's socket). Your \"pam-ussh: check cert against the pam username\" commit hopefully defeats the obvious attack on the authentication (although this depends on some external/setup detail), but it doesn't deal with the pathname probing issue above. Maybe you should re-word the README some further, stating that the module is _only_ meant for use with sudo, and any other use may be unsafe?",

    "vulnerability_information_html": "<h2 id=\"summary\">Summary</h2>\n\n<p><a title=\"https://github.com/uber/pam-ussh\" href=\"/redirect?signature=36081c7fc55f6e89aa49e115ab0c2a58dc2e7cf3&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fuber%2Fpam-ussh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://github.com/uber/pam-ussh</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a> was open-sourced today (kudos!) and is presumably used within Uber&#39;s infrastructure. This is a PAM module written a Go that &quot;will authenticate a user based on them having an ssh certificate in their ssh-agent signed by a specified ssh CA.&quot; A cursory look at the code and the documentation reveals that the module trusts the SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment variable to determine the Unix domain socket it will use to talk to ssh-agent:</p>\n\n<p><a title=\"https://github.com/uber/pam-ussh/blob/a50585bb7a0f16cd4e813509ad1393731cbb9a14/pam_ussh.go#L70\" href=\"/redirect?signature=2c6e038e66a025bbd58177d370d82f3f763f7ab1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fuber%2Fpam-ussh%2Fblob%2Fa50585bb7a0f16cd4e813509ad1393731cbb9a14%2Fpam_ussh.go%23L70\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://github.com/uber/pam-ussh/blob/a50585bb7a0f16cd4e813509ad1393731cbb9a14/pam_ussh.go#L70</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a></p>\n\n<p>The documentation suggests configuring the module for sudo&#39;s PAM stack. Since sudo is normally installed SUID root and invokes its PAM stacks with root privileges, it may happily talk to another user&#39;s ssh-agent via that other user&#39;s and agent&#39;s Unix domain socket, despite of this socket not being accessible to the invoking user directly (since it&#39;s protected with Unix file permissions). Being an environment variable, SSH_AUTH_SOCK is under control of the user/attacker invoking sudo. In other words, the code and suggested setup effectively bypass Unix file permissions on ssh-agent sockets.</p>\n\n<p>This appears to be a design error of pam-ussh.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"security-impact\">Security Impact</h2>\n\n<p>A local user may trick pam-ussh and thus sudo to authenticate itself using another local user&#39;s certificate. This other user has to be currently logged in, with ssh-agent active. (The attack script may wait for this condition to be met.) The attacking user doesn&#39;t have to possess any certificate at all, nor use ssh-agent themselves. In fact, the attack may likely be mounted even by a compromised system service pseudo-user, provided that sudo is within its reach.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"reproduction-steps\">Reproduction Steps</h2>\n\n<p>Not having access to a setup that Uber actually uses within its infrastructure, I can only be moderately confident that this security issue applies and these steps will work. That said, the reproduction steps may be roughly as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Login (over SSH or otherwise) as a non-privileged user to a shell account on a system with pam-ussh deployed for sudo.</p></li>\n<li><p>Check the process list and directories matching /tmp/ssh-* for instances of ssh-agent and their sockets corresponding to other logged in users. If none, then wait until this changes.</p></li>\n<li><p>Infer the target user&#39;s ssh-agent socket pathname by listing /tmp/ssh-* and obtaining the PID from the process list. The pathname may be of the form /tmp/ssh-RND/agent.PID, where the &quot;RND&quot; and &quot;PID&quot; portions are determined from the directory listing and the process list, respectively.</p></li>\n<li><p>Invoke a command like &quot;SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/tmp/ssh-RND/agent.PID sudo bash&quot; with the &quot;RND&quot; and &quot;PID&quot; substituted with substrings identified above.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"specifics\">Specifics</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If applicable, what account were you using to test?\n\n<ul>\n<li>N/A</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If applicable, what domain(s) does this vulnerability affect?\n\n<ul>\n<li>Unclear - it&#39;s internal infrastructure that might be in use behind a variety of Uber services</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Does this only affect specific versions or vendors?\n\n<ul>\n<li>pam-ussh at least as published on GitHub as of today (Feb 8, 2017)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This might or might not be within scope of Uber&#39;s bug bounty program, and I have not actually reproduced the issue - only having identified its likelihood through the source code and documentation. Yet I figured I&#39;d give this communication channel a try, and report this. I&#39;d appreciate a review of these findings and any feedback you might provide.</p>\n\n<p>A related concern is that Go&#39;s runtime might not be suitable for use in SUID/SGID programs yet - e.g., it might also have environment variables it trusts too much, as well as many other issues that libc&#39;s have been hardened against over the years (and decades). I have not looked into that yet, but you might want to.</p>\n",
