The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a <frame> or <iframe>. Sites can use this to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.\n\nThis vulnerability affects Web Server.\n\nAs far as i know this data is enough to prove that your site is vulberable to Clickjacking..\naccording to OWASP its more than enough..\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Clickjacking_(OWASP-CS-004)\n\nSolution\n\nhttps://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking_Defense_Cheat_Sheet\ncheck this out..here is the solution for that.\n\nRefer the attached screenshot for issue details.\n",

The X-Frame-Options HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not a browser should be allowed to render a page in a &lt;frame&gt; or &lt;iframe&gt;. Sites can use this to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not embedded into other sites.</p>\n\n<p>This vulnerability affects Web Server.</p>\n\n<p>As far as i know this data is enough to prove that your site is vulberable to Clickjacking..<br>\naccording to OWASP its more than enough..<br>\n<a title=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Clickjacking_(OWASP-CS-004)\" href=\"/redirect?signature=d28ea39cb2454acbca82e25656bd837dcc40ba4b&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.owasp.org%2Findex.php%2FTesting_for_Clickjacking_%28OWASP-CS-004%29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_Clickjacking_(OWASP-CS-004)</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a></p>\n\n<p>Solution</p>\n\n<p><a title=\"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking_Defense_Cheat_Sheet\" href=\"/redirect?signature=dbbd8d94e83d7a17051c50eb5a6ffc0473048c1f&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.owasp.org%2Findex.php%2FClickjacking_Defense_Cheat_Sheet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking_Defense_Cheat_Sheet</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a><br>\ncheck this out..here is the solution for that.</p>\n\n<p>Refer the attached screenshot for issue details.</p>\n",
