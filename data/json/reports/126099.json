Sure, there could be 20 bugs which are easy to fix by disabling everything. It doesn't follow that impact of 19 of them was zero.\n\nHow does the hypotethical thought of 20 theoretical bugs nullify the real bugs I reported? The risk of running software containing 20 bugs is higher, not lower than with 1 bug per software. That is so unintuitive that it would have been fair to mention it.\n\nI don't think conforming to your own written policy should be \"unrealistic\". **If** you think your system really has so many bugs that it's unrealistic for a multi-billion company to reward them, then launching a bounty program wasn't a good idea and clearly someone (many of them) didn't do their job. But I did, your security was substantially improved as a result, and most of my work getting dismissed as worthless is not good.\n\nAnd for the record, ranting about this may seem pointless due to your [stated](http://www.valuewalk.com/2016/03/uber-bug-bounty-program/) and apparent reluctance to negotiate about the bounties. However I think it's a good thing to discuss the conventions and practices of bug bounties in general. I'm not just worried about 2 lost weeks, but the longer run. Making bounty policies consistent, predictable, and trustworthy benefits everyone and vice versa.\n",

Sure, there could be 20 bugs which are easy to fix by disabling everything. It doesn&#39;t follow that impact of 19 of them was zero.</p>\n\n<p>How does the hypotethical thought of 20 theoretical bugs nullify the real bugs I reported? The risk of running software containing 20 bugs is higher, not lower than with 1 bug per software. That is so unintuitive that it would have been fair to mention it.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think conforming to your own written policy should be &quot;unrealistic&quot;. <strong>If</strong> you think your system really has so many bugs that it&#39;s unrealistic for a multi-billion company to reward them, then launching a bounty program wasn&#39;t a good idea and clearly someone (many of them) didn&#39;t do their job. But I did, your security was substantially improved as a result, and most of my work getting dismissed as worthless is not good.</p>\n\n<p>And for the record, ranting about this may seem pointless due to your <a href=\"/redirect?signature=c627e1ef6b3dc36165d13bec2c8a4f23178ed92d&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.valuewalk.com%2F2016%2F03%2Fuber-bug-bounty-program%2F\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>stated</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a> and apparent reluctance to negotiate about the bounties.
