Login and go to https://hackerone.com/settings/teams > __Visibility__\n2. Click Concealed / \tRevealed to manipulate showing or hiding it in your profile.\n3. Capture the request using burp (please see the graphql POST request above)\n4. Decode the value of base64: \"team_member_id\":\"Z2lkOi8vaGFja2Vyb25lL1RlYW1NZW1iZXIvNDM3OTQ=\" > `gid://hackerone/TeamMember/<team_member_id>`\n5. Change the value of `<team_member_id>` to victims team member id (other team member)\n6. Forward the request, your co-team member profile settings will be edited.\n\n__NOTE:__ I ask permission to my friend which is member if parrot sec, I used this test profile https://hackerone.com/parrotsec1 to perform IDOR against this other team member profile: https://hackerone.com/phspade , both are team members of parrot sec. I successfully remove the public __Teams__ visibility of other team member @phspade without user interaction.\n\nLet me know if anything else is needed.\n\nRegards\n@pinoywhitehat\n\n",
