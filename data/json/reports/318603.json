That is not normal.  \n\n**Impact:**\nServers can lockup because of this.  Look at this Github discussion about a similar issue to yours which has caused servers to lockup for another Webmaster experiencing the same issue as yours. \n\nhttps://github.com/maartenba/MvcSiteMapProvider/issues/258\n\n## Browsers / Apps Verified In:\n\nGoogle Chrome\n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. Visit http://lahitapiola.fi/sitemap.xml or https://lahitapiola.fi/sitemap.xml\n  2.  You will notice just how long it takes to load your sitemap.  It takes so long that every hit on your server for Sitemap request, will harm your server CPU and other resources. \n\n## Additional material\n\n To reduce load, the sitemap can be split into many sitemaps. \n\n## Related reports, best practices\n\n## Impact\n\nThis impacts your ability to run your web applications efficiently and will thus affect your ability to run your business smoothly.",

I am able to cause an Internal Server Error on your server, and this means I was able to successfully affect your server side PHP or other code to get confused or to glitch and show this error. This error is not supposed to happen at all, seeing this error means something about your backend code is misconfigured.  Just visit <a title=\"https://secure.lahitapiola.fi/index?ripplepaperwallet.com%22/%3E\" href=\"/redirect?signature=b300b7514582b7ce3a3b813be224e3f4f165da28&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.lahitapiola.fi%2Findex%3Fripplepaperwallet.com%2522%2F%253E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://secure.lahitapiola.fi/index?ripplepaperwallet.com%22/%3E</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a></p>\n\n<p>The correct behavior that is supposed to happen is that your server should ignore the extra parameters I passed on, and should instead redirect me to another page, or not do anything and just keep me on the same original page.  See screenshot please.  I do believe this one has an impact on your business.</p>\n",

That is not normal.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Impact:</strong><br>\nServers can lockup because of this.
