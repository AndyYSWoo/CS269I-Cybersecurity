    "vulnerability_information": "Hi HackerOne,\n\n**Summary:**\n\nI have found a way that it is possible to harvest all private invitation using the new __Leave Program__ feature together with the `security@` email forwarding feature __without any user interaction__.\n\n---\n\n**Description:**\n\nFirst, when the program activated the `security@` email forwarding on hackerone and the hacker sent an email to `security@company.com` which is activated, hackerone system will send an invite to hackers and this invite will allow hackerone to become a participants of private program.\n\nNow, hackers can choose to leave to the program in __exchange__ of another automated invite when the hackers filled-up the leave program survey form using the new __Leave Program__ functionality. (see image below)\n\n{F282541}\n\n\n---\n### Now how to exploit it ? , very easy.. hackerone will do it for you fully automated without any user interaction\n---\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\n\nAssumes that you don't have any invites (as in 0 invites)\n\n  1. First step you have to find program with `security@` email forwarding enabled on hackerone, this is easy just go to https://hackerone.com/bug-bounty-programs, click all the program and send a test email to their declared `security at` email on their public page, if you received a response to submit your bug, then that means `security@` is activated in hackerone.  \n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\n  2. Lets take `\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588`, send a test mail to that address\n  3. You will received an invitation email via `security@` email forwarding feature.\n  4. Click the __Submit Vulnerability__ , you are now a participants.\n  5. Now leave the program and fill-up the leave survey then confirm leave.\n  7. You'll be fast-tracked for invites, invitation will come most likely arriving in the next 24 hours as stated.\n  8. __REPEAT STEP 2 to 7__ after getting a new invite came from fast-tracked invites.\n\n__NOTE:__ Ask more information if you are having trouble understanding my submission.__\n\nBut this is easy to exploit, just send an email to: `\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 > get invites > leave to \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 > get new invites came from fast-tracked > repeat`\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can harvest all private invitation without any user interaction, in a matter of few months you can have 100+ private invitation by just daily repeating the steps i provided above.\n\n__INVITES ALL YOU CAN__\n\nLet me know if you need more information.\n\nCheers\nJapz",
