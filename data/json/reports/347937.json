            "message": "Hi @jobert, thanks so much for spending time to go through our reports. For the benefit of @nismo, I will clarify my doubts here as well.\n\nI think the thing that I (and perhaps @nismo) are most confused about is the distinction between private and sandboxed programs. I understand from your program's policy that information disclosures that do not distinguish between these types of programs are considered out of scope. \n\nSeeing that the previous report #342978, in which both @nismo and I had filed duplicates on, made use of a similar property (in that case `whitelisted_hackers`) to identify if an external program was actually running a private program, what is the exact difference between that report and this report, _in terms of distinguishing between sandboxed and private programs_?\n\nBased on your explanation, let me try to see if what I understood is correct: \n\n1. Sandboxed programs cannot accept submissions from the general public, while \"private programs\" (in your terminology) refers to programs that _do_ accept submissions, regardless of whether the program is viewable (i.e. external program).\n2. The `whitelisted_hackers` field only applies to \"private programs\", since this count supposedly only counts invited researchers.\n3. Meanwhile, the absence of `FEATURE_GATED` from `i_cannot_create_jira_webhook_reasons` can show that a program exists under the handle, regardless if it is sandboxed or \"private\".\n\nTherefore, what you're saying is that:\n\n1. _There is no vulnerability_ if we can tell if an external program is running a program that hasn't been launched\n2. _There is a vulnerability_ if we can tell whether an external program is \"private\" or sandboxed, i.e. whether they are a paying customer\n\nI think the reason why we are confused is that we don't have any examples of what a sandboxed (and not \"private\") program looks like. In addition, in report #342978 you said (and I quote):\n\n> this issue can be used to determine whether external programs in our Directory are running private programs\n\nThis led us to believe that there is indeed a vulnerability if we could tell if an external program was running a program under the handle, since we could already tell that some of them (notably \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, or companies with their own bug bounty programs like \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588) would not have a private program in HackerOne. The findings in this report as well as my own duplicate in #349172 were based on this assumption.\n\nIt would be helpful if you could confirm/provide a precise definition of the four states of a program you are referring to, in order to avoid future invalid reports.\n\nThanks once again, and sorry for the long reply!", 
            "markdown_message": "<p>Hi <a href=\"/jobert\">@jobert</a>, thanks so much for spending time to go through our reports. For the benefit of <a href=\"/nismo\">@nismo</a>, I will clarify my doubts here as well.</p>\n\n<p>I think the thing that I (and perhaps <a href=\"/nismo\">@nismo</a>) are most confused about is the distinction between private and sandboxed programs. I understand from your program&#39;s policy that information disclosures that do not distinguish between these types of programs are considered out of scope. </p>\n\n<p>Seeing that the previous report <a href=\"/reports/342978\">#342978</a>, in which both <a href=\"/nismo\">@nismo</a> and I had filed duplicates on, made use of a similar property (in that case <code>whitelisted_hackers</code>) to identify if an external program was actually running a private program, what is the exact difference between that report and this report, <u>in terms of distinguishing between sandboxed and private programs</u>?</p>\n\n<p>Based on your explanation, let me try to see if what I understood is correct: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Sandboxed programs cannot accept submissions from the general public, while &quot;private programs&quot; (in your terminology) refers to programs that <u>do</u> accept submissions, regardless of whether the program is viewable (i.e. external program).</li>\n<li>The <code>whitelisted_hackers</code> field only applies to &quot;private programs&quot;, since this count supposedly only counts invited researchers.</li>\n<li>Meanwhile, the absence of <code>FEATURE_GATED</code> from <code>i_cannot_create_jira_webhook_reasons</code> can show that a program exists under the handle, regardless if it is sandboxed or &quot;private&quot;.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Therefore, what you&#39;re saying is that:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\n<u>There is no vulnerability</u> if we can tell if an external program is running a program that hasn&#39;t been launched</li>\n<li>\n<u>There is a vulnerability</u> if we can tell whether an external program is &quot;private&quot; or sandboxed, i.e. whether they are a paying customer</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I think the reason why we are confused is that we don&#39;t have any examples of what a sandboxed (and not &quot;private&quot;) program looks like. In addition, in report <a href=\"/reports/342978\">#342978</a> you said (and I quote):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>this issue can be used to determine whether external programs in our Directory are running private programs</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This led us to believe that there is indeed a vulnerability if we could tell if an external program was running a program under the handle, since we could already tell that some of them (notably \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, or companies with their own bug bounty programs like \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588) would not have a private program in HackerOne.

I agree that this may be true in some cases, but there's no guarantee.\n\nAny company can claim an external program page on HackerOne. They can do this without running a program. When they've claimed a program page, they can maintain their policy in the Directory to make sure it's up to date with their own. It also means that the community can't contribute anymore to that page. When they've claimed the page, they can create a program in our demo environment. Within our demo environment, you can freely pick a product edition. Depending on which one they pick to poke around, you'll see the `FEATURE_GATED` error being returned. It may also mean that they're running a private program. Because of the number of different cases you can't guarantee that they are running a program. If your goal is to enumerate all the programs I don't see how this would get you any closer to your goal, because you could reach out to the company anyway (asking for invites isn't tolerated though).\n\nIt reveals about the same amount of information as signing in with `user@some-sso-enabled-domain.com` and getting redirected to a company's SSO provider or trying to sign up for a user with a company name and realizing it's already been taken (anyone could've taken this). Long story short: this doesn't meet the requirements for a bounty, but like I said, we'll go ahead and award swag for it. Thanks for your understanding!",
