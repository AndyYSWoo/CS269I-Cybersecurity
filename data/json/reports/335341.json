    "vulnerability_information": "**Summary:** \nIt's possible to get information about the users registered (such as: id, name, login name, etc.) without authentication in Wordpress via API on www.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi. \n\n**Description:** \nBy default Wordpress allow public access to Rest API to get informations about all users registered on the system. \n\n## Steps To Reproduce:\n\n  1. It's possible to reproduce the attack by browsing the URL:\nhttps://www.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi/?rest_route=/wp/v2/users/1\nhttps://www.lahitapiolarahoitus.fi/?rest_route=/wp/v2/users/2\n\n  2. Just increase the last number of the Endpoing of API  (/?rest_route=/wp/v2/users/{id}) to get all users registered information on the Wordpress\n\n**Remediation:** \nThere are 2 ways that it's possible to fix this problem.\n**FIX 1** - It's possible to remove this access for anyone by change the source code where when someone request the Rest API and the server send a 404 (Not Found) message for the user who made the request. \nReference: https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API/issues/2338\n\n**FIX 2** - It's also possible to create a rewrite rule on .htaccess (if the webserver it's Apache) to redirect any request that contain rest_route (eg.: \"^.\\*rest_route=/wp/\\*\") to a Not Found (404) or a Default Page.\n\n## Impact\n\nIt's possible to get all the users registered on the system and create a bruteforce directed to these users.",
