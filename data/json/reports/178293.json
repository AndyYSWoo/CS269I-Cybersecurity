Victim A uses victim@googapps.com with password and 2FA to login (Thinks he is secure).\n\n2. Victim A then activates \"Sign In with Google\" for his store.\n3. Victim A logs in with Google (Still thinks he is secure, But he is not because Shopify's 2FA gets disabled without letting user know)\n\n4. Now Attacker B who by chance knows the password of `victim@googapps.com` can login into the Admin Panel without 2FA **or access to Victim A's Google Account**\n\n**Please note Attacker B does not require access to Google account, Just Email and Password of Shopify** because Email and Password is still valid even after activating \"Sign In with Google\"\n\n**Also this is valid for accounts which once used Email and Password to login and then migrated to \"Sign In with Google\"**\n\n#### Why ?\n1. Because Shopify's 2FA gets disabled when you login with \"Sign In with Google\"\n2. Traditional login with Email and Password does not get disabled when you activate \"Sign In with Google\"\n\n#### Fix\n\n1. If you are depending on Google Apps for security, Disable login with Email and Password for that store\n2. Don't disable Shopify's 2FA when someone logs in with \"Sign In with Google\"\n\n",
