I then created test programs (Sandboxed) for each one of those accounts. You can see them in the [] brackets in the screenshot. </p>\n\n<p>I then set triggers for each of these programs to send an auto response on submission of a vulnerability. I then went ahead and submitted vulns to each one of these programs. </p>\n\n<p>As a result, I got an email from the HackerOne platform (notice via HackerOne in the screenshot).

    "vulnerability_information": "Hello,\n\nThis was a very weird behavior that I observed and I am not sure exactly what is causing this but I trust you guys to dig into this more.\n\nSo, basically in a sandboxed program, when I set a trigger for an auto-response, I am getting emails from the HackerOne platform as a user who has no relationship with that program. \n\nCheck the screenshot attached. \n\nI basically created multiple accounts on the H1 platform. I then created test programs (Sandboxed) for each one of those accounts.
