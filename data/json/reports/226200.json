When the LHS is an `NODE_SCALL` it goes to the base case. It returns and never gets to the bottom line `if (val) push(val);` which is necessary for the rest of the code to use the correct register. Because it is not pushed, it uses the register below it in the stack, which allows us to manipulate arguments in an unchecked manner to other opcodes.\n\nIf this is used in conjunction with `OP_ARYCAT` from the splat operator, one could point the destination of OP_ARYCAT to a fake RArray with any arbitrary memory as the ptr, resulting in a memory write (I'm currently experimenting with this to corrupt strings and get code execution). \n\n# Solution\nIn order to fix this, either having the error for improper LHS code generation should either be fatal and kill the program, or switching `return;` to `break;` will fix the error. However, in the future, there should be some level of verification the the destination of `OP_ARYCAT` is actually an RArray to prevent it being used in memory corruptions.\n\n# Versions Affected\n\nThe code above was tested on the latest master. The bug itself appears to have been created in commit `88cd807379152ea3fec5f534e5f4d6ebebd53982`.",

When the LHS is an <code>NODE_SCALL</code> it goes to the base case. It returns and never gets to the bottom line <code>if (val) push(val);</code> which is necessary for the rest of the code to use the correct register. Because it is not pushed, it uses the register below it in the stack, which allows us to manipulate arguments in an unchecked manner to other opcodes.</p>\n\n<p>If this is used in conjunction with <code>OP_ARYCAT</code> from the splat operator, one could point the destination of OP_ARYCAT to a fake RArray with any arbitrary memory as the ptr, resulting in a memory write (I&#39;m currently experimenting with this to corrupt strings and get code execution). </p>\n\n<h1 id=\"solution\">Solution</h1>\n\n<p>In order to fix this, either having the error for improper LHS code generation should either be fatal and kill the program, or switching <code>return;</code> to <code>break;</code> will fix the error. However, in the future, there should be some level of verification the the destination of <code>OP_ARYCAT</code> is actually an RArray to prevent it being used in memory corruptions.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"versions-affected\">Versions Affected</h1>\n\n<p>The code above was tested on the latest master.
