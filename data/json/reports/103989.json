You should know that I finally figured out how to send messages to oh noes guy while skipping your html property filter <strong>completely</strong>.  It&#39;s not exactly pretty, but it&#39;s possible:</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>(function() {\n    // we need to wait until after the &quot;program ended&quot; message gets sent, or our message will be quickly removed\n    // for this example, we want the user to see the XSS, so we want the message to get sent 1 second after the &quot;program ended&quot; message\n    this.setTimeout(function() {\n        this.parent.postMessage(this.JSON.stringify({\n            results: {\n                errors: [{\n                    text: &quot;&lt;h1&gt;HOLA MUNDO!&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;script&gt;console.log(location.href);&lt;/script&gt;&quot;,\n                    row: 8 // :D\n                }]\n            }\n        }), &quot;*&quot;);\n    }, 1000);\n})();\n</code></pre>\n<p>If it doesn&#39;t seem to work, wait a second and press the &quot;Hmmm...&quot; next to error buddy below the program to open the message.  Even without pressing the &quot;Hmmm...&quot;, the JavaScript seems to be run.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, given that you can do that, you should probably not even try to fix <code>Object.defineProperty</code> hole and skip right to putting error buddy inside the iframe.  Maybe, at least for now, you could even do something with stacking iframes.  All the message handling and error buddy stuff could be inside an iframe inside the main page, so the iframe with the output would be two levels deep.</p>\n",

I spent a bunch of time looking into this yesterday, and I have another fix which i think should work, for both the XSS you sent and another related one I found; a coworker just pointed out another variation on mine so I'm going to fix that too and then push it to the site.  (For the `text` attribute in your most recent version, we'll just need to do the same thing we do for `html` and construct anything that we want to display unsanitized outside the iframe; that's equally easy to do, we just overlooked it.  At this point we're going to be doing property whitelisting, so it should be easy to just audit how we use all the other properties we allow through.)\n\nI think putting the error buddy inside the iframe is going to at the very least take us some more time -- it's a significant change, even if we do it with nested iframes (and I think that would be a performance nightmare, although maybe worth it in the short term).  And in any case, we do still need *some* access to some information from the inside the iframe to know if you have, for example, completed a challenge, so we'll need to be able to correctly sanitize that.  I'll definitely make sure that we look into moving error buddy inside the iframe, but at this point I don't think it'll happen before the holidays, so I'm going to try to get a simpler fix out today that will at least prevent the issues we know about.\n\nAgain, thanks for your work on reporting this!",
