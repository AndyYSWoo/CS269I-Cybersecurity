Go to https://hackerone.com/reports/182358\n  2. Export the report as .zip\n  3. Now extract the .zip file (`HackerOne_Report-security#182358.zip`)\n  4. You will see that the image is still there, but base on the thread, you guys removed it on disclosed report.\n\nI have attached the .zip file downloaded and save on my local and i can still view the removed image.\n\n__Disclosed partially removed attachment:__ {F138022}\n\nRegards\nJapz\n",
