Initially this report was dismissed based on the existing risk assessment. The reporter however showed exemplary persistence and did a very thorough rebuttal of the bug bounty team's conclusions and decisions. The issue was then escalated within L\u00e4hiTapiola with the specific angle of privacy and potential information leak of privacy sensitive data.
