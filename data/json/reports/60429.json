What about researchers?\nYou are having a personal perspective from team's side and not from the researchers. Let me explain your business model.\n\nHackerOne takes `20%` of bounty awarded by any program. \neg. `RelateIq` rewards researcher Pranav for his bug report with `100$` bounty then `HackerOne` earns `20$` i.e `20%` from that.\n\nSo, HackerOne should always keep in mind that without researchers they are nothing.\nIf researchers don't submit any valid bugs to programs then hackerOne will not earn anything.
