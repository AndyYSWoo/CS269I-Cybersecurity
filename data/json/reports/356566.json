    "vulnerability_information": "**How was i able to to know the state of report using Hackerone Support:**\nI was able to know the state of report using different email address by contacting Hackerone Support. So the thing is this is my report https://hackerone.com/reports/344238 which is not even disclosed and closed as informative and which is reported by with this email address \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 . I sent email to hackerone support using this email address \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 which is totally different from the email i reported the vulnerability from what i wrote in the email was \u2018May i know why it isn\u2019t closed as resolved and still pending?\nhttps://hackerone.com/reports/344238\u2019 i didn\u2019t even say that this report is closed as informative i just said that \u2018why is it not closed as informative yet\u2019 and after 1 day i got email from Hackerone Staff saying: Hi Aman, Thank you for reaching out to us with this concern. I have taken a look and disclosure was requested on the 1st of May. If the company does not disable disclosure the report will be disclosed at that time. However, disclosure can be disabled if the report is closed as informative, not applicable, duplicate or spam.\nThis information about the report is disclosed by support of the report which is not even disclosed yet and by using totally different email and just a same name i was able to get that information by support team. Would recommend hackerone support to verify email first before disclosing any information. \nHackerone Support Request # 246046 \nAlso the picture is attached aswell.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker can know the state of report by using different email address . The report which is not even disclosed we are able to know information about it.",

I agree with you that we can't exploit this vulnerability for a total unknown person. Anyhow this vulnerability can easily be exploited if we know a colleague, friend, known person who's a reporter on hackerone. What an attacker would do if someone is attacker's friend/colleague/known person, an attacker would ask just for the report id i do agree that an unknown person won't give any of his report id but yes if an attacker asks for report id from their colleague/friend or a known person there are about 60-70% chances that they'll give report id to the attacker what attacker does for getting report id is depends on attacker, as they trust hackerone and know that there is no way that an attacker would be able to get any type of information about report so they might give it to attacker. As attacker already know them so of-course attacker will have their hackerone username as they were attacker's friend/colleague/known person because we just need a username as you've said that `one of our support representatives made a judgement call based on the username that was shown in the ticket. There's an account associated with both email addresses @ amans and @ amans1` so attacker will make a account with similar username and send an email to support@hackerone.com impersonating the real reporter. I instantly made a report after getting the disclosure date. An attacker might ask for more information about report and may ask to do some actions on behalf of the real reporter as attacker is impersonating the real reporter.\nSo i believe this should be considered as a `Medium vulnerability` as attack is not that much complex and we're getting a most secret information easily that is about a report which is not even disclosed. \n\nEven thou @amans1 account was disabled so hackerone support team didn't even check the account status as well.\n\nThanks",

I thought that information about the state of undisclosed report from support would be okay as a PoC for you to analyze the impact but unfortunately you&#39;re sticked to the <code>state</code> of report. I didn&#39;t expect that! If this was other program i would&#39;ve surely asked for more information from support but as this was HackerOne Program i thought that information about the state of undisclosed report would be okay for you to judge the impact .</p>\n",

So the thing is this is my report <a title=\"https://hackerone.com/reports/344238\" href=\"https://hackerone.com/reports/344238\">https://hackerone.com/reports/344238</a> which is not even disclosed and closed as informative and which is reported by with this email address \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 . I sent email to hackerone support using this email address \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 which is totally different from the email i reported the vulnerability from what i wrote in the email was \u2018May i know why it isn\u2019t closed as resolved and still pending?<br>\n<a title=\"https://hackerone.com/reports/344238%E2%80%99\" href=\"https://hackerone.com/reports/344238%E2%80%99\">https://hackerone.com/reports/344238%E2%80%99</a> i didn\u2019t even say that this report is closed as informative i just said that \u2018why is it not closed as informative yet\u2019 and after 1 day i got email from Hackerone Staff saying: Hi Aman, Thank you for reaching out to us with this concern. I have taken a look and disclosure was requested on the 1st of May. If the company does not disable disclosure the report will be disclosed at that time. However, disclosure can be disabled if the report is closed as informative, not applicable, duplicate or spam.<br>\nThis information about the report is disclosed by support of the report which is not even disclosed yet and by using totally different email and just a same name i was able to get that information by support team. Would recommend hackerone support to verify email first before disclosing any information. <br>\nHackerone Support Request # 246046 <br>\nAlso the picture is attached aswell.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"impact\">Impact</h2>\n\n<p>An attacker can know the state of report by using different email address . The report which is not even disclosed we are able to know information about it.</p>\n",
