This is not cool.</li>\n<li>There is a potential for the developers of a project to declare all security bug reports as invalid to save money.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Our team members have an established history of reporting vulnerabilities to large open source projects. <strong>We aren&#39;t in the business of ripping people off.</strong> When in doubt, our policy is to err on the side of generosity.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"scope\">Scope</h2>\n\n<p>We&#39;re only interested in the <em>source</em> repositories in the <a href=\"https://github.com/paragonie\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>ParagonIE</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a> organization on Github that have at least seen a version <code>1.0.0</code> stable release, not any repositories we forked (which we usually only do when fixing a security vulnerability in the upstream repository).
