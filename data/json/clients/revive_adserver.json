Do not test an instance of Revive Adserver that you do not own. This includes any existing instance you might find anywhere on the web. If you report an issue against an instance you do not own, it will not be accepted. Instead, install your own instance of Revive Adserver. This will let you test the Revive Adserver software without disrupting others.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>IMPORTANT: SERVER CONFIGURATION ISSUES DO NOT QUALIFY</strong>. Do not report configuration issues with <code>revive-adserver.com</code> etc. For example: software versions, SPF headers, etc. These are outside of program scope. The goal of this program is to find vulnerabilities in the Revive Adserver software itself.
