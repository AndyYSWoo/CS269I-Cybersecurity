Someone should probably fix it. It&#39;s likely not getting fixed in the next release.</li>\n<li>\u2264$250 \u2014 This is definitely a real problem that puts Brave users at risk. We will ship a fix in a scheduled release. Custom hacker swag available upon request.</li>\n<li>\u2264$500 and beyond \u2014 A really bad problem. We&#39;re probably going to ship a fix for this before our next scheduled release.

We may publicly disclose the issue before resolving it, if appropriate. </li>\n<li>Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service. Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder.</li>\n<li>If you would like to encrypt your report, please use the PGP key with long ID <code>5273 5B5A AAFA F9B1 B40A  7222 6B64 A862 A4C7 8E4B</code> (available in the public keyserver pool).</li>\n<li>We are generally happy to publicly disclose reports two weeks after shipping the release which contains the fix. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1 id=\"program-notes\">\u2139\ufe0f Program notes</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The output of an analysis tool doesn&#39;t constitute a report on its own. Please submit a PoC or describe in detail the specific attack which you&#39;ve identified.</li>\n<li>We prefer it when hackers file one report per bug, no matter how many different ways that underlying issue can be exploited. This makes it easier for us to understand what you&#39;re reporting and track our progress in fixing the issue. If fixing the problem described in one report would also prevent the troubling behavior described in another report of yours, those issues should probably be combined.</li>\n<li>We are a relatively small team with a relatively large project to protect. Please bear with us if it takes a few days for us to validate and triage your report. Sometimes reports get lost in the shuffle, and we need a reminder. The best way to do this is to comment on your report and <a href=\"/mention\" target=\"_blank\">@mention</a> the Brave team member(s) you were working with. If this doesn&#39;t get our immediate attention, we are probably all putting out a fire, but you can also email <a title=\"security@brave.com\" href=\"mailto:security@brave.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">security@brave.com</a>.
