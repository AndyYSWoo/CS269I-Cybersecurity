Thank you!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2 id=\"new-opportunity-grand-theft-auto-online-incorrect-ban-bounty\">New Opportunity:  Grand Theft Auto Online - Incorrect Ban Bounty</h2>\n\n<p>We occasionally receive support tickets from people who have been suspended for cheating in Grand Theft Auto Online, denying that any cheating took place and claiming a \u201cfalse-positive\u201d. We take these claims seriously and investigate them thoroughly. However, we have yet to find any evidence to support these claims.</p>\n\n<p>We are offering a <strong>$10,000 bounty</strong> for any researcher who can successfully identify a reproducible incorrect ban in Grand Theft Auto Online. The types of activities that people have claimed (but we do not believe) to have caused bans include: using legitimate visual overlays (e.g. FPS) or audio chat integrations, other players spamming the in-game reporting system and having cash/rank forced on them by modders, but please do not limit yourselves to investigating these methods.</p>\n\n<p>The privacy, security and experience of our users are of the utmost importance. Under no circumstances may any testing target or negatively affect our users. You must use only accounts you own and/or created specifically for testing purposes.</p>\n\n<p>The rules of this targeted bounty are simple:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>You must only be working with your own Social Club accounts that you register with this bounty program prior to any testing (see details below).</p></li>\n<li><p>You must show that the banned account was using an unaltered, retail copy of Grand Theft Auto V on PC.</p></li>\n<li>\n<p>The ban must not be the result of any deliberate attempts to modify the game or the test account. On the PC where the ban occurs you must not be using:</p>\n\n<p>a. custom code</p>\n\n<p>b. esoteric software where we cannot verify the author or their (innocuous) intent</p>\n\n<p>c. mods or other software designed to give an unfair advantage in video games</p>\n\n<p>d. debuggers, disassemblers, real-time memory editors, instrumentation tools, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You must not negatively impact the game-play experience of other players while researching this bounty.</p></li>\n<li><p>We must be able to both independently reproduce the steps and verify the ban on your test account.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Our focus is on continuing to ensure that our anti-cheat system does not ban anyone who is playing the game normally and consistently with our terms of service. Any reports that are inconsistent with the spirit of what we are focused on will be ineligible for a bounty and closed. Furthermore, no complaints or commentary about existing bans will be reviewed. Note that bans incurred as a result of violating our terms of service will not be reversed. However, if anybody were to successfully illustrate a reproducible inappropriate ban, any banned test accounts would of course be restored.</p>\n\n<p>In order to participate in this bounty, please submit our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfU2Wtngvy38YcYBweTt7HjE0ST1t_Slv4QMcn4zk-wpQjosA/viewform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>enrollment form</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a> and await an invitation to our private VIP bounty program.  <strong>We will not accept reports pertaining to this targeted bounty that are submitted to this program page.</strong> </p>\n",
