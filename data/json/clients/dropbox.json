Critical submissions include vulnerabilities such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Remote Code Execution</li>\n<li>SQLi</li>\n<li>SSRF</li>\n<li>XXE</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>XSS vulnerabilities (reflected or otherwise) will not be considered critical.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"consequences-of-complying-with-this-policy\">Consequences of Complying with This Policy</h1>\n\n<p>We will not pursue civil action or initiate a complaint to law enforcement for accidental, good faith violations of this policy. We consider activities conducted consistent with this policy to constitute \u201cauthorized\u201d conduct under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. To the extent your activities are inconsistent with certain restrictions in our Acceptable Use Policy, we waive those restrictions for the limited purpose of permitting security research under this policy. We will not bring a DMCA claim against you for circumventing the technological measures we have used to protect the applications in scope.</p>\n\n<p>If legal action is initiated by a third party against you and you have complied with Dropbox\u2019s bug bounty policy, Dropbox will take steps to make it known that your actions were conducted in compliance with this policy.</p>\n\n<p>Please submit a HackerOne report to us before engaging in conduct that may be inconsistent with or unaddressed by this policy.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-fine-print\">The Fine Print</h1>\n\n<p>You are responsible for paying any taxes associated with rewards. We may modify the terms of this program or terminate this program at any time. We won\u2019t apply any changes we make to these program terms retroactively. Reports from individuals who we are prohibited by law from paying are ineligible for rewards. Dropbox employees and their family members are not eligible for bounties.</p>\n\n<p>In order to encourage the adoption of bug bounty programs and promote uniform security best practices across the industry, Dropbox reserves no rights in this bug bounty policy and so you are free to copy and modify it for your own purposes. </p>\n",
