Rewards include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Open-Xchange-branded Swag: T-Shirts, Polo Shirts, Hoodies</li>\n<li>Minimum reward of $100 for vulnerabilities we consider to be serious, up to a maximum of $5000 for the most severe vulnerabilities</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Due to logistical issues and subsequent overhead and disappointment on both sides, we&#39;re not sending Swag packages to locations with notorious weak infrastructure. In this case we&#39;re awarding a amount below the minimum reward to compensate.</p>\n\n<p>We will respond to your reports as soon as possible, bounty however will be assigned once a week after reviewing and rating the reports in terms of impact and risk.</p>\n\n<p>Open-Xchange will determine in its discretion whether a reward is being granted as well as its amount. In particular we may choose to pay higher rewards for severe vulnerabilities or lower rewards for vulnerabilities that are considered less severe. When doing our estimation we&#39;re using CVSS and map the score against our payout-grades. This means certain aspects are of importance when considering the reward for a specific issue, for example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Does it affect all users or would a practical attack require significant effort to compromise a wider range of users?</li>\n<li>What level of authentication at the attacker and victim side is required to make the attack work?</li>\n<li>Are social-engineering vectors (e.g. phishing) required to execute the vulnerability?</li>\n<li>Is the attack vector remotely exploitable and are multiple steps required to execute it?</li>\n<li>Does the attack require interaction of the victim to be effective?</li>\n<li>Does the attack rely on weaknesses in third party components on the victims side?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Based on this evaluation of impact and severity it could be that issues which is similar on a technical side gets different ratings and subsequently payout. We&#39;re not having a fixed amount of reward for a specific kind of issue. Note that the scale between minimum and maximum payout is not linear. We reserve the right to change these program rules at any time without prior announcement.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for helping keep Open-Xchange and its users safe!
