We appreciate the role the security research community plays in fulfilling this objective. We are committed to the pursuit of collaborative effort with this community to improve our security and we wish to acknowledge and recognize those who have made an effort to improve our security. If you believe you&#39;ve discovered a security issue within our guidelines, we encourage you to report the issue to us. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"scope\">Scope</h2>\n\n<p>The scope of this program is limited to technical vulnerabilities on FormAssembly related applications and services under the following domains:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>*.formassembly.com (except help.formassembly.com)</li>\n<li>*.tfaforms.com</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Testing is <strong>prohibited</strong> for the following hostname patterns:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>*.tfaforms.net</li>\n<li>formassembly.disqus.com</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Any reports including these domains will be automatically rejected and the user will be subject to permanent disqualification from this program.</p>\n\n<p>No testing is permitted against production enterprise resources, regardless of hostname.

Our staff will assess each report to determine if it is an eligible disclosure. We strive for a quick response, but we will respond to your report within 30 days. Additionally, we will request up to 90 days to implement a fix depending on the severity and complexity of the report. </p>\n\n<p>Implementing a fix is not the same as releasing a fix. The release of a fix will be determined based upon the severity and complexity of the disclosure. Due to the complexity of deployments at FormAssembly, a release may not occur within the 90 day window. We will keep you updated during this process. </p>\n\n<p>We also believe that 30 day response, 90 day resolution timeline is a reasonable timeline to govern our process.

You can help expedite the review process by providing this information in your initial report. </p>\n\n<p>As a general rule, providing as much relevant information in the disclosure will ensure an expedited response.
