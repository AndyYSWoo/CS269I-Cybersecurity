This does not include third party libraries covered by other bug bounty programs, such as IBB. For the avoidance of doubt, this does exclude OpenSSL, but libevent is still in scope.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"excluded-vulnerabilities\">Excluded vulnerabilities</h3>\n\n<p>This section specifies an incomplete list of vulnerabilities that are <em>NOT</em> in scope for this bug bounty program.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s because these attacks or issues arise from unanswered research questions and not because of bugs in the Tor software. While Tor may attempt to defend against some of these attacks, any defense is a mitigation and should not be considered indicative of a strong security boundary. Other excluded attacks depend on users doing obviously unsafe tasks which we also consider as out of scope to this program and try to address by educating users.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an incomplete list of excluded vulnerabilities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Tagging attacks or other types of end-to-end traffic confirmation using  packet modification or timing, such as <a title=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack/\" href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack/</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a> or <a title=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough\" href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a>\n</li>\n<li>Website and Traffic Fingerprinting Attacks, a good round-up is <a title=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/critique-website-traffic-fingerprinting-attacks\" href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/critique-website-traffic-fingerprinting-attacks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://blog.torproject.org/blog/critique-website-traffic-fingerprinting-attacks</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a>\n</li>\n<li>Using Tor against recommendations. There are several ways to configure Tor or use it insecurely including insecurely configuring it (e.g. setting  alternate Directory Authorities), leaking your IP address through  torrents, or opening downloaded files in external applications such as  document writers.</li>\n<li>Attacks that are possible by an attacker outside the software&#39;s threat model.  (For example, Tor assumes that the attacker does not have administrator access to your computer; has not installed a keylogger; does not control a majority of directory authorities; cannot make an authenticated connection to the control port; and so on.)</li>\n<li>When users go to the wrong hidden service address, they get the wrong hidden service.</li>\n<li>Timing side-channel attacks that can only be exploited at great difficulty, and only by local users.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"tor-browser\">Tor Browser</h2>\n\n<p>For Tor Browser the tiers, price ranges and restrictions are the following:</p>\n\n<p>Generally there is no reward for anything already in our public bugtracker. This holds for Mozilla&#39;s bugtracker as well, with exceptions (see below). If you claim an additional bounty to the one from Mozilla we need to have notice about this specific issue before the bug gets public.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"low-100-1000\">Low ($100 - $1000)</h3>\n\n<p>This tier is for third-party/supercookie tracking issues:</p>\n\n<p>a. Non-fingerprinting (identifiers/cookies/etc): $1000</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Can be claimed either for supercookies that survive &quot;New Identity&quot; or for other mechanisms to track users across sites.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>b. Fingerprinting (Reward depends on accuracy and/or entropy):  $100-1000</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>No reward for browser version differentiation</li>\n<li>No reward for OS differentiation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"medium-1000-2000\">Medium ($1000 -$2000)</h3>\n\n<p>This tier is for unexploitable crashes caused by Tor Browser patches and NoScript bypasses to get arbitrary scripts to run:</p>\n\n<p>a. Unexploitable Tor Browser crashes caused by Tor Browser patches: $1000-$2000</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>remotely triggerable ones</li>\n<li>indirectly triggerable ones by a remote attacker (an attacker succeeds in convincing a user to do certain things that crash the browser)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>b. NoScript bypass to get any script to run $1000-$2000</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"high-2000-3000\">High ($2000 - $3000+)</h3>\n\n<p>This tier is for serious security bugs that may result in users getting deanonymized or compromised.</p>\n\n<p>a. &quot;Uncontrolled&quot; Partial Proxy Bypass: $2000</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>E.g.: DNS resolution via non-Tor (<a title=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/5741\" href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/5741\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://bugs.torproject.org/5741</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a>)</li>\n<li>Other non-Tor connection to an IP address that is not under an attacker&#39;s control (For instance STUN server, Mozilla.org server, etc etc)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>b. Full Proxy bypass: $3000</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Direct non-Tor connection to an IP address of the attacker&#39;s choice</li>\n<li>Full code execution vulnerabilities not eligible for this bounty (i.e. c. and d.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>c. Tor Browser-Specific Code Exec Base Bounty: $3000</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Applies to code exec vulnerabilities against our specific addons/paches/preference choices</li>\n<li>Can only be claimed in cases where Mozilla&#39;s bounty does not apply</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>d. Bonus over Base Bounty/Mozilla Bounty for code execution exploits that work in:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Medium Security Slider Level on an HTTPS page: 50% Bonus</li>\n<li>Medium Security Slider Level on a non-HTTPS page: 75% Bonus</li>\n<li>High Security Slider Level: 100% Bonus</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If there are security bug reports you want to send directly to us, feel free to contact us via <a title=\"tor-security@lists.torproject.org\" href=\"mailto:tor-security@lists.torproject.org\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">tor-security@lists.torproject.org</a>.</p>\n",
