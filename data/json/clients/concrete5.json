No administrative access is required to exploit the bug. The bug does not provide access on its own. It would have to be part of a larger attack, often involving some social engineering. These are considered a high priority and are typically patched immediately by the core team in github and launched in the next version of the core. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Internal Attack Vector</strong> - A bug that requires someone already have some type of administrative access to the CMS.
