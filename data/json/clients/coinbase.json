Responsible Disclosure includes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Providing Coinbase a reasonable amount of time to fix a vulnerability prior to sharing details of the vulnerability with any other party.</li>\n<li>Making a good faith effort to preserve the confidentiality and integrity of any Coinbase customer data.</li>\n<li>Not defrauding Coinbase customers or Coinbase itself in the process of participating in the Bug Bounty Program.</li>\n<li>Not profiting from or allowing any other party to profit from a vulnerability outside of Bug Bounty Program payouts from Coinbase. </li>\n<li>Reporting vulnerabilities with no conditions, demands, or ransom threats.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Coinbase considers Social Engineering attacks against Coinbase employees be a violation of Program Policies.  Researchers engaging in Social Engineering attacks against Coinbase employees will be banned from the Coinbase Bug Bounty program.  We define Social Engineering as acts that influence people to perform security-impacting actions or divulge confidential information.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"report-evaluation\">Report Evaluation</h1>\n\n<p>In order to be deemed valid, a report must demonstrate a software vulnerability in a service provided by Coinbase that harms Coinbase or Coinbase customers.  Reports that include a clear Proof of Concept or specific step by step instructions to replicate the vulnerability are considerably more effective at communicating a researcher\u2019s findings and are therefore far more likely to be deemed valid.</p>\n\n<p>A report must be a valid, in scope report in order to qualify for a bounty.  Coinbase awards bounties based on severity of the vulnerability.  We determine severity based on two factors: Impact and Exploitability.</p>\n\n<p>Impact describes the effects of successful exploitation upon Coinbase systems or customers.  We make this assessment primarily by examining the effects of exploitation on confidentiality, integrity, or availability of underlying information.  Vulnerabilities that require considerable response and remediation efforts or could result in reputational damage are also considered to have greater impact.  For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Critical Impact: Attackers can read or modify Sensitive Data in a system, execute arbitrary code on the system, or exfiltrate digital or fiat currency in some way.</li>\n<li>Low Impact: Attackers can gain small amounts of unauthorized, low sensitivity information impacting a subset of users, or slightly impact accuracy and performance of system.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Exploitability describes the difficulty of actively exploiting the vulnerability itself.  We make this assessment primarily based on the prerequisites for exploitation, including level of access required, availability of information critical for successful exploitation, and likelihood of alignment of required factors outside the attacker&#39;s direct control such as social engineering requirements or timing requirements.  For example:   </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Critical Exploitability: Attackers can unilaterally exploit the finding without significant roadblocks or special conditions outside attacker control.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Low Exploitability: Exploitation is difficult due to several requirements, such as access limitations, complicated social engineering, guessing unknown values, or alignment of unpredictable race conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Severity is determined as a combination of Impact and Exploitability.  For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Critical Severity: a state of immediate, easily accessible threat of large-scale compromise or irreversible damage to Coinbase or Coinbase customers.</li>\n<li>Low Severity: a state of no immediate threat where an opportunity exists for an improvement that may mitigate a potential future vulnerability.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In order to provide general guidelines to researchers regarding the payouts that can be expected for a given report, Coinbase uses the severity of a report to place the report into one of the following tiers.  </p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left\">Vulnerability Tier</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: right\">Reward</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Critical</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right\">$50,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">High</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right\">$15,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Medium</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right\">$2,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Low</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right\">$200</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>The payouts listed next to each tier are minimum bounties for the tier.  Bonuses in excess of the tier minimum can be awarded based on the severity of the vulnerability or creativity of the exploitation.  Researchers are also more likely to earn a larger reward for exceptionally clear and high-quality reports.  </p>\n\n<p>Previous bounty amounts are not considered precedent for future bounty amounts.  Software is constantly changing and therefore the given security impact of the exact same vulnerability at different times in the development timeline can have drastically different security impacts.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"scope\">Scope</h1>\n\n<p>The Coinbase Bug Bounty program scope covers all software vulnerabilities in services provided by Coinbase.  </p>\n\n<p>Specific domains hosting Coinbase services are provided below:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>*.coinbase.com  (All assets on coinbase.com and subdomains, excepting services provided by third parties)</li>\n<li>*.cbhq.net (All assets on cbhq.net and subdomains, excepting services provided by third parties)</li>\n<li>com.coinbase.android (Android: Play Store Coinbase app)</li>\n<li>com.coinbase.ios (iOS: App Store Coinbase app)</li>\n<li>54.175.255.192/27 (All Coinbase provided services hosted on this block of IPs)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The following subdomains host services provided by third parties, and therefore are explicitly out of program scope.  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>blockr.io</li>\n<li>blog.coinbase.com</li>\n<li>community.coinbase.com</li>\n<li>engineering.coinbase.com</li>\n<li>developers.coinbase.com</li>\n<li>status.coinbase.com</li>\n<li>support.coinbase.com</li>\n<li>beta.coinbase.com</li>\n<li>support.gdax.com</li>\n<li>blog.gdax.com</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Additionally, all vulnerabilities that require or are related to the following are out of scope:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Social engineering</li>\n<li>Physical security</li>\n<li>Non-security-impacting UX issues</li>\n<li>Deprecated Open Source libraries are not in scope.

We make this assessment primarily based on the prerequisites for exploitation, including level of access required, availability of information critical for successful exploitation, and likelihood of alignment of required factors outside the attacker&#39;s direct control such as social engineering requirements or timing requirements.  For example:   </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Critical Exploitability: Attackers can unilaterally exploit the finding without significant roadblocks or special conditions outside attacker control.<br>\n</li>\n<li>Low Exploitability: Exploitation is difficult due to several requirements, such as access limitations, complicated social engineering, guessing unknown values, or alignment of unpredictable race conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Severity is determined as a combination of Impact and Exploitability.  For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Critical Severity: a state of immediate, easily accessible threat of large-scale compromise or irreversible damage to Coinbase or Coinbase customers.</li>\n<li>Low Severity: a state of no immediate threat where an opportunity exists for an improvement that may mitigate a potential future vulnerability.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In order to provide general guidelines to researchers regarding the payouts that can be expected for a given report, Coinbase uses the severity of a report to place the report into one of the following tiers.  </p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align: left\">Vulnerability Tier</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: right\">Reward</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Critical</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right\">$50,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">High</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right\">$15,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Medium</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right\">$2,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\">Low</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right\">$200</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>The payouts listed next to each tier are minimum bounties for the tier.  Bonuses in excess of the tier minimum can be awarded based on the severity of the vulnerability or creativity of the exploitation.  Researchers are also more likely to earn a larger reward for exceptionally clear and high-quality reports.  </p>\n\n<p>Previous bounty amounts are not considered precedent for future bounty amounts.  Software is constantly changing and therefore the given security impact of the exact same vulnerability at different times in the development timeline can have drastically different security impacts.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"scope\">Scope</h1>\n\n<p>The Coinbase Bug Bounty program scope covers all software vulnerabilities in services provided by Coinbase.  </p>\n\n<p>Specific domains hosting Coinbase services are provided below:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>*.coinbase.com  (All assets on coinbase.com and subdomains, excepting services provided by third parties)</li>\n<li>*.cbhq.net (All assets on cbhq.net and subdomains, excepting services provided by third parties)</li>\n<li>com.coinbase.android (Android: Play Store Coinbase app)</li>\n<li>com.coinbase.ios (iOS: App Store Coinbase app)</li>\n<li>54.175.255.192/27 (All Coinbase provided services hosted on this block of IPs)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The following subdomains host services provided by third parties, and therefore are explicitly out of program scope.  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>blockr.io</li>\n<li>blog.coinbase.com</li>\n<li>community.coinbase.com</li>\n<li>engineering.coinbase.com</li>\n<li>developers.coinbase.com</li>\n<li>status.coinbase.com</li>\n<li>support.coinbase.com</li>\n<li>beta.coinbase.com</li>\n<li>support.gdax.com</li>\n<li>blog.gdax.com</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Additionally, all vulnerabilities that require or are related to the following are out of scope:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Social engineering</li>\n<li>Physical security</li>\n<li>Non-security-impacting UX issues</li>\n<li>Deprecated Open Source libraries are not in scope.
