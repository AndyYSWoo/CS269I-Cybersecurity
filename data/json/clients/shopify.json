We expect the same in return from all participants. To achieve this, our team strives to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Reply to all reports within one business day and triage within two business days (if applicable)</li>\n<li>Determine security impacts transparently</li>\n<li>Award bounties within a week of resolution (excluding extenuating circumstances)</li>\n<li>Only close reports as <code>N/A</code> when the issue reported is included in <code>Known Issues</code>, <code>Ineligible Vulnerabilities Types</code> or lacks evidence of a vulnerability</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>All valid vulnerabilities will be awarded our minimum amount, $500, on triage with the remainder awarded on resolution.</strong> </p>\n\n<h1 id=\"accounts\">Accounts</h1>\n\n<p>We encourage security researchers to sign up for a whitehat partner account, which allows you to create shops and private Shopify apps for testing within the program guidelines, <a title=\"https://app.shopify.com/services/partners/signup/whitehat\" href=\"https://app.shopify.com/services/partners/signup/whitehat\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://app.shopify.com/services/partners/signup/whitehat</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a>. </p>\n\n<p>You must use a whitehat partner account to create shops for testing or <strong>use your HackerOne email address, YOURHANDLE @ wearehackerone.com (e.g. hackerjuan @ wearehackerone.com) so we can properly identify your shop</strong>. Doing so may also give you access to new features on your shop before the feature is fully released.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"eligibility\">Eligibility</h1>\n\n<p>The scope of the whitehat program is limited to the domains listed at the bottom of this page. <strong>Valid vulnerabilities on any domain not explicitly listed in scope will be accepted but are ineligible for a reward.</strong> For example, vulnerabilities on any Shopify owned app or channel not listed below will not be awarded a bounty unless impact on Shopify core can be demonstrated. Vulnerabilities found in Shopify third party apps should be reported to the responsible developer. You should only report vulnerabilities in Shopify third party apps to Shopify under this program if you do not receive a satisfactory response from the responsible developer.</p>\n\n<p>All software components that are used within the Shopify application may be exploited in your attack, including bugs in the Liquid templating engine, its C performance extension, the Ruby interpreter (MRI), the Ruby on Rails framework, as well as third party libraries that we use (such as Ruby gems). Please note that bugs in third party components only qualify if you can prove that they can be used to successfully attack Shopify.

We expect the same in return from all participants. To achieve this, our team strives to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Reply to all reports within one business day and triage within two business days (if applicable)</li>\n<li>Determine security impacts transparently</li>\n<li>Award bounties within a week of resolution (excluding extenuating circumstances)</li>\n<li>Only close reports as <code>N/A</code> when the issue reported is included in <code>Known Issues</code>, <code>Ineligible Vulnerabilities Types</code> or lacks evidence of a vulnerability</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>All valid vulnerabilities will be awarded our minimum amount, $500, on triage with the remainder awarded on resolution.</strong> </p>\n\n<h1 id=\"accounts\">Accounts</h1>\n\n<p>We encourage security researchers to sign up for a whitehat partner account, which allows you to create shops and private Shopify apps for testing within the program guidelines, <a title=\"https://app.shopify.com/services/partners/signup/whitehat\" href=\"https://app.shopify.com/services/partners/signup/whitehat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>https://app.shopify.com/services/partners/signup/whitehat</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a>. </p>\n\n<p>You must use a whitehat partner account to create shops for testing or <strong>use your HackerOne email address, YOURHANDLE @ wearehackerone.com (e.g. hackerjuan @ wearehackerone.com) so we can properly identify your shop</strong>. Doing so may also give you access to new features on your shop before the feature is fully released.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"eligibility\">Eligibility</h1>\n\n<p>The scope of the whitehat program is limited to the domains listed at the bottom of this page. <strong>Valid vulnerabilities on any domain not explicitly listed in scope will be accepted but are ineligible for a reward.</strong> For example, vulnerabilities on any Shopify owned app or channel not listed below will not be awarded a bounty unless impact on Shopify core can be demonstrated. Vulnerabilities found in Shopify third party apps should be reported to the responsible developer. You should only report vulnerabilities in Shopify third party apps to Shopify under this program if you do not receive a satisfactory response from the responsible developer.</p>\n\n<p>All software components that are used within the Shopify application may be exploited in your attack, including bugs in the Liquid templating engine, its C performance extension, the Ruby interpreter (MRI), the Ruby on Rails framework, as well as third party libraries that we use (such as Ruby gems). Please note that bugs in third party components only qualify if you can prove that they can be used to successfully attack Shopify. Only original reports will be rewarded.</p>\n\n<p>If you need further clarification of the rules or scope of our bug bounty program, you may email us at <a title=\"bugbounty@shopify.com\" href=\"mailto:bugbounty@shopify.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">bugbounty@shopify.com</a>.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"typical-bounty-amounts\">Typical Bounty Amounts</h1>\n\n<p>In most cases, we will <strong>only</strong> reward the type of vulnerabilities that are listed below. These payouts represent the typical amount awarded per category and we reserve the right to decrease or increase any of them based on our own assessment of impact. Bounty amounts for any vulnerability type not listed below will be determined on a case by case basis at the sole discretion of Shopify.</p>\n\n<p><em>Prior bounty amounts awarded are not precedent for future payments.</em></p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Shopify Core*</th>\n<th>Non-Core**</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Arbitrary code execution</td>\n<td>$10,000 - $25,000</td>\n<td>$2,500 - $12,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>SQL Injection</td>\n<td>$10,000 - $20,000</td>\n<td>$2,500 - $10,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Privilege escalation to shop owner</td>\n<td>$5,000 - $15,000</td>\n<td>$2,000 - $7,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Authentication bypass - login</td>\n<td>$5,000 - $10,000</td>\n<td>$2,000 - $5,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Authentication bypass - app installation</td>\n<td>$2,500 - $7,500</td>\n<td>$1000 - $3,750</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>IDOR / Information Disclosure</td>\n<td>$1,000 - $5,000</td>\n<td>$500 - $2,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Circumvention of user permission model</td>\n<td>$500 - $4,000</td>\n<td>$500 - $2,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Server side request forgery</td>\n<td>$500 - $4,000</td>\n<td>$500 - $2,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cross-site scripting - stored <strong>(with exceptions below)</strong>\n</td>\n<td>$500 - $5,000</td>\n<td>$500 - $2,500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cross-site scripting - reflected <strong>(with exceptions below)</strong>\n</td>\n<td>$500 - $2,500</td>\n<td>$500 - $1,250</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cross-site scripting - self <strong>(with exceptions below)</strong>\n</td>\n<td>$500</td>\n<td>$500</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cross-site request forgery</td>\n<td>$500 - $1,500</td>\n<td>$500 - $750</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><em>Self-XSS will be awarded at our sole discretion based on whether it&#39;s reasonable to believe a Shopify admin could be tricked into executing the payload (e.g., pasting a code snippet into an applicable text field) not covered in the exclusions below.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Core means your Shopify store front and administrative pages at /admin.
