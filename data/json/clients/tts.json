These issues are unlikely to be eligible for an award, and will usually be considered invalid for the purposes of our program:\r\n\r\n- Violations of secure design principles that are not part of exploitable vulnerabilities\r\n- Missing SPF/DKIM/DMARC entries.\r\n- CSRF on forms available to anonymous users (e.g., contact forms)\r\n- Logout CSRF\r\n- HTTP/TLS configuration issues without demonstrable impact, such as:\r\n    - TLS configuration issues such as BEAST, BREACH, renegotiation attacks, insecure cipher suites, etc.\r\n    - Missing HTTP security headers\r\n    - Lack of Secure or HTTPOnly cookie flags\r\n- Non-sensitive information disclosure (i.e., server versions, software stack, etc) on error message pages, 404 pages, and so forth.\r\n- Presence (or absence) of application/browser autocomplete or save-password flags.\r\n- Username enumeration on login or forgot password pages.\r\n- Reports about missing rate limiting where other mitigations exists (for example, brute force attacks against login pages already protected by MFA).\r\n- Lack of \"security speedbumps\" when leaving sites/applications.\r\n- Clickjacking attacks that don't lead to any sensitive state stages.\r\n- HTTP OPTIONS/TRACE methods enabled.\r\n  \r\n### Eligibility\r\n \r\nIf you submit a qualifying, validated vulnerability, you may be eligible to receive a bounty award subject to the terms below:\r\n \r\n- We embrace [open source software](https://18f.gsa.gov/open-source-policy/). While we welcome the submission of any vulnerability that impacts in-scope services, we may not be able to award a bounty for submissions where the root-cause vulnerability was introduced by an upstream library.\r\n- You are not currently nor have been an employee or contractor of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) within 6 months prior to submission\r\n- You are not a family or household member of an employee or contractor of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) as described above\r\n- You must meet all HackerOne Bug Bounty eligibility requirements, such as not being subject to trade restrictions or export sanctions as determined by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).\r\n\r\n",

We look forward to working alongside skilled security researchers across the globe to help further improve the security posture of TTS-owned services.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"philosophy\">Philosophy</h3>\n\n<p>As the first program of its kind, we expect to evolve its structure over time and welcome feedback on areas for improvement. The following criteria guide our thinking:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Common Practices:</strong> Wherever it makes sense, TTS desires to learn from and follow industry common practices in bounty programs. We will deviate only when there is a clear and specific need.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Competitive:</strong> We seek to provide competitive bounty amounts. Leveraging HackerOne platform data, new services will be introduced with median or higher reward levels and typically increase over time.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Open:</strong> Our intent is for each service to be open to public participation. We will start with private programs only as a stepping stone toward public.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Responsive:</strong> TTS is comprised of many autonomous technical teams. Only teams that commit to and maintain positive levels of responsiveness to researchers will be included.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"vulnerability-disclosure-policy\">Vulnerability Disclosure Policy</h2>\n\n<p>Participation in this program is governed by the <a href=\"https://github.com/18F/vulnerability-disclosure-policy/blob/master/vulnerability-disclosure-policy.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><span>Vulnerability Disclosure Policy</span><i class=\"icon-external-link\"></i></a> of the Technology Transformation Service. Please fully review the linked policy prior to your participation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bug-bounty\">Bug Bounty</h2>\n\n<p>The bug bounty program of the Technology Transformation Service is special in that it aims to cover numerous individual services that been developed to address a diverse range of public use cases. Our strategy is to introduce services into scope at regular intervals. We offer tiered bounty levels based primarily on the length of time each service has been in scope.</p>\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><em>Severity\u00b9</em></th>\n<th><em>Initial\u00b2</em></th>\n<th><em>Standard\u00b3</em></th>\n<th><em>Login.gov Only</em></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Critical</td>\n<td>$2,000</td>\n<td>$5,000</td>\n<td>$5,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>High</td>\n<td>$750</td>\n<td>$2,000</td>\n<td>$2,000</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Medium</td>\n<td>$300</td>\n<td>$750</td>\n<td>$300</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>$150</td>\n<td>$250</td>\n<td>$150</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>\u00b9 By default, Severity will be assessed according to CVSS v3.<br>\n\u00b2 The initial bounty amounts for newly included services targets the 75th percentile award level based on current HackerOne platform data.<br>\n\u00b3 Services that have been in scope for a reasonable period of time graduate to higher award levels.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"scope\">Scope</h3>\n\n<p>The Technology Transformation Service is comprised of many autonomous technical teams operating multiple of services. While the services below offer bounties, all others do <em>not offer bounties</em>. Please review this scope section carefully before proceeding.
