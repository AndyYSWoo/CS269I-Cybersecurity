Priority is based on impact and urgency, and is used to identify required times for actions to be taken.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Whenever we triage a report, a <em>CVSS v3.0 Base Score</em> metric is set which evaluates the technical severity of the reported issue and allows us to prioritise the fix. Once a patch has been submitted and verified, we will then evaluate the total CVSS score by including the <em>Environmental Score</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for helping us keep Liberapay safe!</p>\n",

In order for you to demonstrate the actual impact of this value, we highly recommend you look for an XSS vulnerability. Try to trigger `alert(document.domain)`. |\r\n| Disclosure of robots.txt file | We are aware that in some cases robots.txt files have been known to disclose sensitive information. In our case we have determined that our robots.txt files do not contain any information that poses a potential security risk. |\r\n| Email spoofing (SPF misconfigurations) | We have accepted the risk that this issue poses and do not believe that it warrants an immediate fix. |\r\n| Open redirect using `Host` header | Open redirects in the `Host` header are not exploitable. |\r\n\r\nAs a rule of thumb, pretty much everything listed below is a non-issue:\r\n\r\n{F304365}\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udcce Proof of concepts\r\n\r\n| Issue type | When to report the issue |\r\n|------------|--------------------------|\r\n|  XSS      |     For XSS, a simple `alert(document.domain)` should suffice. |\r\n|  RCE     |  Please only execute harmless code. Simply printing something or evaluating an expression should be enough to demonstrate the issue.  |\r\n|   SQLi         |   Report it as soon as you have a SQL error that indicates SQL injection or you are able to disclose the SQL server's version number.       |\r\n| Unvalidated redirect | Set the redirect endpoint to http://example.com if possible. |\r\n| CSRF | Either attach a file to demonstrate the issue or paste the code in a code block in your report. |\r\n| SSRF | Do not go playing around on any internal networks. Report as soon as you believe that you have a potential SSRF issue and we will look into it for you. |\r\n| LFI | The same applies here \u2014 please do not go against the guideline listed in the *Disclosure policy* section. We investigate LFI reports in a dev environment to make sure it is valid. |\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udcdd Advice\r\n\r\nWe encourage hackers to read [Web Hacking 101](https://leanpub.com/web-hacking-101) and [Breaking into Information Security: Learning the Ropes 101](https://leanpub.com/ltr101-breaking-into-infosec) to get a good idea of the type of issues that we are looking for.\r\n\r\n## \ud83d\udcda Terminology\r\n\r\nThe term \"severity\" is frequently used interchangeably with \"impact\" or \"priority\". This section defines our terminology in order to prevent any potential confusion. We use the *Oxford Dictionaries'* definition of \"severity\" and *Information Technology Infrastructure Library's* definitions of the two latter terms.\r\n\r\n**Severity**\r\n\r\n> The fact or condition of being severe.\r\n\r\n**Impact**\r\n\r\n>  A measure of the effect of an incident, problem or change on business processes. Impact is often based on how service levels will be affected. Impact and urgency are used to assign priority.\r\n\r\n**Priority**\r\n\r\n> A category used to identify the relative importance of an incident, problem or change. Priority is based on impact and urgency, and is used to identify required times for actions to be taken.\r\n\r\nWhenever we triage a report, a *CVSS v3.0 Base Score* metric is set which evaluates the technical severity of the reported issue and allows us to prioritise the fix. Once a patch has been submitted and verified, we will then evaluate the total CVSS score by including the *Environmental Score*.\r\n\r\nThank you for helping us keep Liberapay safe!",
